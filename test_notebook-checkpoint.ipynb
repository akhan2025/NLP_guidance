While we\\'re clearly operating in a very fluid environment, we successfully navigated through one of the most challenging times in our company\\'s history and remain cautiously optimistic about the road ahead. Looking back at fiscal 2021, we saw a number of positives, and I\\'m proud of the role we played in helping to shepherd the return of live entertainment in New York as our venues hosted the city\\'s first large-scale events since the start of pandemic. Tao Group did their part as well, helping to bring back the critically important hospitality industry, while returning to profitability in the June quarter.</p> <p>And with the acquisition of Hakkasan Group in April, we believe Tao is well positioned to build on its track record of success. We also continued to make meaningful progress on our next chapter, MSG Sphere in Las Vegas, heading toward the venues opening in calendar 2023. And in early July, our acquisition of MSG Networks created a company with greater scale and revenue diversity as well as enhanced financial flexibility. This was all accomplished during a very difficult year when our performance venues and Tao Group properties were largely closed or operating with significant restrictions and both the Christmas Spectacular and Boston Calling Music Festivals were canceled.</p> <p>We\\'ve talked throughout the year about the important steps we took during this uncertain period, including reductions in our spending, lengthening our construction timetable for MSG Sphere in Las Vegas and completing a $650 million debt raise. These actions strengthened our balance sheet, while protecting our core entertainment business. And while conditions have improved, we continue to monitor what\\'s happening in our markets. This includes New York City\\'s announcement earlier this month that while venues can continue to welcome people at 100% capacity, all guests who are dining indoors or attending indoor performances are required to show proof of at least one vaccination shot, which we think is beneficial for our businesses.</p><div class=\"interad\"></div> <p>We operate in the New York market, which already has one of the highest vaccination rates in the country, and our research indicates that our fans in this market prefer attending vaccinated events. We saw this firsthand during the fourth quarter, starting with the sold-out Knicks playoff games, where we hosted nearly 90% vaccinated crowds as well as across a number of concerts, which were sold at 100% capacity to all vaccinated audiences. Looking forward, we have begun to staff up in anticipation of what we envision could be a busy year ahead. While we\\'re mindful of what\\'s happening with the Delta variant, including the cancellation of certain shows around the country, we think that vaccination policies that are increasingly being adopted by cities, including New York as well as companies in our industry, will be helpful.</p> <p>We currently expect concert touring to begin ramping back up in late September, leading to a strong concert booking schedule on a full-year basis. In fact, fiscal 2022 is currently pacing ahead of fiscal 2020, which as you may recall, was slated to be a record bookings year for our company prior to the onset of the pandemic. In addition, we continue to see enthusiastic levels of consumer demand through strong sales as new shows get announced. And Christmas in New York is back.</p> <p>Last month, we announced that tickets are officially on sale for the 2021 season of the Christmas Spectacular production. We are pleased with the early sales for the season\\'s 163-show run and are looking forward to the production\\'s return. We also recently entered into a long-term lease renewal with favorable terms for Radio City Music Hall, which extends our lease until 2038, with an option to renew for an additional 10 years. We are pleased to have worked with Tishman Speyer on this agreement, which is a win-win for all parties involved as it ensures this landmark venue remains home of the Christmas Spectacular for many years to come.</p> <p>Turning to Tao Group. Fourth-quarter results include the impact of the Hakkasan Group acquisition, which created a global leader in premium hospitality with over 60 venues across five continents. The acquisition expands Tao\\'s U.S. presence in major entertainment markets, such as Las Vegas, Southern California and Miami, while providing instant international foothold in destinations like London and the Middle East.</p> <p>This increased footprint also provides local expertise to support further expansion. Another area where Hakkasan will help drive the business is through its expertise in licensing, which Tao intends to utilize alongside its owned and managed venue models as it continues to pursue growth opportunities. The easing of capacity restrictions in the fourth quarter helped drive strong results for Tao, with the majority of its revenue and AOI generated in the month of June. In addition, the best-performing market for the quarter was Las Vegas, where Tao\\'s presence, which has significantly expanded with the Hakkasan acquisition, will be important to MSG Sphere at The Venetian.</p> <p>We made meaningful progress on MSG Sphere this past fiscal year, achieving a significant milestone in June when we completed the structural steel for the main venue. Over the next 12 months, we intend to complete the roof concrete and the venue\\'s exterior facade as we continue to make progress on the interior build-out and pedestrian bridge. We also plan to move forward with the buildings with building MSG Sphere\\'s exosphere, the spherical structure that will surround the venue and eventually be covered with 580,000 square feet of fully programmable LED lighting. This impactful exterior display is just one of the ways customers will interact with MSG Sphere content.</p> <p>Inside the venue is where we will use state-of-the-art technologies to create first-of-their-kind immersive experiences. And this coming year, we\\'ll increase our focus on developing this content for Sphere. Before I turn things over to Andrea, I\\'d like to spend a moment on the emerging opportunity around mobile sports gaming. New York State\\'s application process is expected to conclude by early January.</p> <p>Many of the leading online sports betting operators are participating in the process, which creates a competitive market that we believe bodes well for us. From entertainment and media assets that reach millions to potential fixed venue-based opportunities that include The Garden and Tao locations, we believe we\\'re one of the best positioned companies to help partners succeed in connecting with consumers. We continue to be in active discussions with many of the potential market participants and are increasingly bullish about this opportunity for our company. In summary, while we know we\\'re in a fluid environment, we\\'re optimistic about the year ahead due to the strong pent-up demand we saw at our entertainment and Tao businesses in June, which has continued so far this summer; our progress with MSG Sphere in Las Vegas; and the powerful platform we have created with MSG Networks, which brings together our entertainment and media assets and positions us well for future opportunities.</p> <p>With that, I will now turn the call over to Andrea.</p><p><strong>Andrea Greenberg</strong> -- <em>President and Chief Executive Officer</em></p> <p>Thank you, Andy, and good morning. Looking back at the past year, our regional sports and entertainment networks faced their own challenges as a result of the pandemic. And we rose to the occasion, delivering our programming on all platforms without interruption, while exploring ways to be more nimble and efficient in producing our content. We will certainly apply our learnings going forward and expect our business to benefit.</p> <p>During fiscal 2021, we were also reminded once again of the power and popularity of live sports, following the return of the NBA and NHL for their shortened 2021 regular seasons. We saw ratings strength on our linear networks, including double-digit percentage increases in average household ratings for the Knicks, Rangers and Islanders regular seasons. We also saw all-time highs for viewership and engagement on MSG GO, our authenticated live streaming app. This strong performance continued into the post season, with ratings for the Knicks and Islanders\\' first-round matchups well exceeding each team\\'s regular season averages.</p> <p>We look forward to welcoming our teams back for the upcoming seasons, which we expect will include normal schedules for the regular seasons. And as we move forward in an evolving media landscape, we remain committed to building on our history of innovation to create value for our partners and viewers. We will continue to experiment with new types of content, including alternative versions of our live game telecast and explore new ways to monetize our media rights and content library through both new and complementary product offerings. We also will remain focused on interactivity, where we\\'ve seen firsthand with our MSG GO app, the benefits of interactive games on engagement and frequency of tune.</p> <p>Furthermore, our ability to aggregate data across our linear networks, digital products and entertainment venues will provide even richer insights into viewers and customers, which we intend to leverage to drive our overall business. This data also makes us an even more valuable marketing partner, including in the emerging world of mobile sports gaming with a significant number of opportunities for MSG Networks, including everything from branded content to integrations on our mobile apps. We\\'re excited about the future and are confident in our ability to continue to innovate and effectively monetize our content, which we believe will ultimately help us drive robust ongoing adjusted operating income. With that, I will turn the call over to Mark.</p><p><strong>Mark FitzPatrick</strong> -- <em>Executive Vice President and Chief Financial Officer</em></p> <p>Thank you, Andrea. Let me start by reviewing our fourth-quarter financial performance, which as a reminder, does not include the results of MSG Networks as the acquisition was completed on July 9. That said, MSG Networks\\' stand-alone results can be found in our press release. And beginning next quarter, we will speak to this segment\\'s results in detail.</p> <p>In the fiscal fourth quarter, we generated revenues of $99.8 million and had an adjusted operating loss of $70 million. In terms of revenue, Tao Group generated $69.7 million. These results included the addition of Hakkasan at the end of April, and as Andy noted, were driven by strong reopening in our key markets, especially in Las Vegas. Revenue also included the impact of our various commercial arrangements with MSG Sports, including $8.3 million in arena license fees as the Knicks and Rangers concluded the regular seasons at The Garden in May, followed by three sold-out Knicks home playoff games.</p> <p>In addition, revenue was positively impacted by both live events and ad sales commissions from MSG Networks. Looking ahead to fiscal 2022, we\\'d like to highlight a few items. First, we\\'ve started to strategically hire across our Entertainment segment to support the anticipated ramp-up of live events starting in late September. We also are working to fully staff our Tao venues to match the reopening momentum at restaurants and nightclubs.</p> <p>Second, we plan to increase our content development and technology investments related to our Sphere initiative. And finally, at MSG Networks, we\\'re anticipating full NBA and NHL seasons, and therefore expect to return to more normalized levels for certain expenses, such as rights fees and normalized advertising revenue. Now let\\'s turn to capital expenditures. We had $130.5 million of capital expenditures in the fiscal fourth quarter, which primarily related to the construction of MSG Sphere in Las Vegas.</p> <p>Through June 30, project to-date construction costs incurred were approximately $850 million, which includes $98 million of accrued costs that were not paid as of June 30 and is net of $65 million received from Las Vegas Sands. As a reminder, last quarter, we announced that the cost estimate for the venue was approximately 10% higher than our previously announced estimate of $1.66 billion. As planned, during our recent annual budget process, we thoroughly reviewed the cost, scope and timeline of the project and have refined our project cost estimate to be approximately $1.865 billion. As construction manager, we will continue to aggressively manage all aspects of the project and are excited for the venues opening in calendar 2023.</p> <p>Finally, turning to our balance sheet. We had approximately $1.17 billion of cash as of June 30 and $1.52 billion if you include MSG Networks\\' $348 million of cash. In terms of debt, the combined company\\'s debt balance was approximately $1.74 billion as of year end. As previously noted, we believe that the merger allows us to optimize our capital structure, including the potential opportunistic refinancing of MSG Entertainment\\'s $647 million term loan, which was put in place during the pandemic last November and carries an interest rate of 7%.</p> <p>With that, I will turn the call back over to Ari.</p><p><strong>Ari Danes</strong> -- <em>Investor Relations</em></p> <p>Thank you, Mark. Can we open up the call for questions?</p> <h2>Questions &amp; Answers:</h2><br/> <p><strong>Operator</strong></p><p>Certainly. [Operator instructions] And your first question is from Brandon Ross of LightShed Partners.</p><p><strong>Brandon Ross</strong> -- <em>LightShed Partners -- Analyst</em></p> <p>Hi, guys. Thanks for taking the question.\\xa0Andy, you mentioned your optimism around sports betting in the near term. I was wondering what your thoughts are on the change in governor, and if you believe that could further open up competition and perhaps even additional ways to monetize betting. And then I have a follow-up.</p> <p>Have a great day.\\xa0</p><p><strong>Andy Lustgarten</strong> -- <em>President</em></p> <p>Great. Thanks, Brandon. So look, I\\'m not going to opine on the politics of what\\'s going on in Albany. What I can talk about is the mobile gaming legislation and how it impacts us.</p> <p>So at a minimum, there\\'s going to be four skins, four operators. This is a tremendous opportunity for us because that\\'s competition. That said, that\\'s the minimum. There can be more.</p> <p>So when we looked at some of the application processes that went in, it gives us real confidence. One group, in their application, talked about a 9-operator model and with a 51% tax rate. In that one, they thought there would be over $900 million of net gross tax revenue generated for the state, and that includes money for marketing. Another group, which only had four operators at a single consortium, pegged the opportunity at $1.3 billion in tax revenue for the state by the third year.</p> <p>So for us, it doesn\\'t -- four or above is all -- it\\'s going to be great and there\\'s going to be competition. They\\'re significant and it\\'s clear there\\'s a significant takeaway for these operators to bring home. And the way they\\'re going to do that is by driving their business. And there\\'s one, we believe, one company best suited to help and work with them, and that\\'s us, right? We blanket the market.</p> <p>We always had a great opportunity between our relationship with MSG Sports and the teams, our fixed asset here at the arena, Tao for hospitality, premium hospitality. But then with the addition of MSG Network, we\\'re able to add linear and digital online content. We can blanket the market in a way no other company can and be a partner for whoever wins. May it be four or more, we\\'re looking at different deal structures, exclusive deals, nonexclusive deals.</p> <p>We\\'re talking to everybody who\\'s in the market, and we think this is a great opportunity for us and a great opportunity for New York State.</p><p><strong>Brandon Ross</strong> -- <em>LightShed Partners -- Analyst</em></p> <p>And then just your stock has been down pretty significantly since the MSGN deal or sort of the original press article surrounding the MSGN deal, and Networks is a real cash flowing asset. I was wondering if you would ever consider using the cash flow from Networks for a stock buyback to be opportunistic with where the stock is.</p><p><strong>Mark FitzPatrick</strong> -- <em>Executive Vice President and Chief Financial Officer</em></p> <p>Thanks, Brandon. It\\'s Mark. I\\'d start by saying our No. 1 priority is always to protect and invest in our core assets.</p> <p>As you saw during the pandemic, that meant preserving our liquidity to position the company to return to business. Second, we are focused on the MSG Sphere initiative, which we continue to see as a unique opportunity, growth opportunity for our company. Finally, we plan to explore refinancing our term loan at MSG Entertainment, which we put in place in the pandemic as an insurance policy and carries a 7% interest rate. So while those represent our near-term focus areas, we regularly review our capital allocation priority.</p> <p>And over time, we\\'ll consider all options in determining the best use of capital. Thank you.</p><p><strong>Brandon Ross</strong> -- <em>LightShed Partners -- Analyst</em></p> <p>Thanks.\\xa0</p><p><strong>Operator</strong></p><p>Thank you.\\xa0Your next question is from John Janedis of Wolfe Research.</p><p><strong>John Janedis</strong> -- <em>Wolfe Research -- Analyst</em></p> <p>Thanks. I had two. First, on the Sphere. As the build continues, can you give us more color on how inflation is impacting your cost versus budget, given the $40 million-or-so increase? Can you give us the puts and takes beyond hitting that, call it, that revised target of the $1.865 billion and you plan to now update on that every quarter versus budget? And then separately, just on the Networks side, can you give us an update on the direct-to-consumer offering? Where are you in the process and timing? Will there be a gaming component with that launch? And are there any more rights that you need or have they all been negotiated? Thanks.\\xa0</p><p><strong>Mark FitzPatrick</strong> -- <em>Executive Vice President and Chief Financial Officer</em></p> <p>John, it\\'s Mark. I\\'ll take the Sphere cost estimate. As I mentioned earlier, we recently reviewed the cost, scope and timeline of the project as part of our annual budget process. This included looking at current inflation trends and the impact to our cost estimates.</p> <p>We\\'ve also taken certain actions to manage our costs. First, we\\'ve secured the majority of the main structural steel for the project, with approximately 90% now fabricated. In addition, we poured approximately 95% of the concrete. Second, we\\'re also watching our supply chain and accelerating the purchase of high-risk items and where possible, identifying alternative manufacturers for certain components such as semiconductors to minimize any potential delays.</p> <p>And finally, we continue to evaluate all aspects of the design to identify opportunities to reduce costs by substituting one product with a comparable one. With that, I\\'ll turn it over to Andrea for the question on Networks.</p><p><strong>Andrea Greenberg</strong> -- <em>President and Chief Executive Officer</em></p> <p>Hi, John. Well, direct to consumer is certainly a developing market opportunity for us. And as you know, for the RSN industry in general, we believe that DTC is really incremental to our business and not a replacement for distribution through our current partnerships. And while we all acknowledge that the drivers to MVPDs have declined, we at MSG Networks still serve approximately 5.5 million subscribers throughout our region, and that\\'s a substantial business.</p> <p>However, when we think about direct to consumer, we do recognize that there are millions of homes throughout our region that do not receive our networks. So for us, the question has been how can we best serve this portion of the market. And we believe there are a number of ways we can do this, all of which we\\'re currently and actively exploring. We could potentially cooperate with our existing distributors to serve the broadband-only customers throughout our market.</p> <p>We could offer a pure DTC product ourselves. We could offer a DTC product for a third party or we could license certain of our content to other market participants. So let me say we recognize the market opportunity and we\\'re actively engaged in evaluating it. As far as rights, we\\'ve indicated in our previous earnings calls that we could offer a direct-to-consumer product.</p> <p>And now we\\'re just in the process of renewing our agreements with the NBA and the NHL, which we\\'ve renewed so many times in the past in the ordinary course.</p><p><strong>John Janedis</strong> -- <em>Wolfe Research -- Analyst</em></p> <p>Thank you.\\xa0</p><p><strong>Operator</strong></p><p>Your next question is from Paul Golding of Macquarie Capital.</p><p><strong>Paul Golding</strong> -- <em>Macquarie Capital -- Analyst</em></p> <p>Great. Thanks so much. A couple of questions. First one, around Hakkasan, is there any color you could give around the pre-pandemic performance of that business just to understand sort of what run rate could look like as it\\'s integrated in Tao under more normal operations? And then I have a follow-up.</p> <p>Thanks.\\xa0</p><p><strong>Andy Lustgarten</strong> -- <em>President</em></p> <p>Sure. Thanks, Paul. This is Andy. So this is actually the first earnings call that we\\'ve had to discuss this acquisition with you.</p> <p>I\\'ll say that we\\'re really excited about it. It\\'s pretty transformative for Tao or Tao-Hakkasan business. In terms of size, rough order, it nearly doubled Tao\\'s revenue base based on 2019 results and it expands Tao\\'s footprint, both here in the U.S. and key international markets such as the U.K., London, specifically Middle East.</p> <p>And it\\'s just -- this is transformative for Tao. I will add. Historically, Tao -- Hakkasan has had a lower stand-alone margin than Tao. So that\\'s part of the opportunity we see here.</p> <p>We think Tao\\'s management team is the best in the industry and they built up a great infrastructure for growth. Both of those will help drive the operational efficiencies that we expect to achieve here at Hakkasan. This will be believed or added to by the economy of scale as we see across both businesses working together, marketing efforts, procurement should drive this business. And in addition, Hakkasan and Tao, while very similar in terms of operating, there were some nuances in how they do in deal structure.</p> <p>Both have lease venues, but in addition, Tao really has more of an expertise in managed venues, which means manage for somebody else, higher -- a little bit lower revenue, but a big piece of profit and a higher margin. So we will look to those structures at the right time for Hakkasan brands. And vice versa, Hakkasan is very strong in licensing. And so we will look for Tao to capitalize on Hakkasan\\'s licensing expertise to enter markets that we may never would have entered on our own as operating.</p> <p>So we think this is a great opportunity for both businesses to come together. What you\\'ve seen has been a great fourth quarter there as was included in the results. The headline, the robust has been in demand so far. It\\'s been across all of our markets, particularly in Las Vegas.</p> <p>I\\'ll add that the momentum hasn\\'t stopped in July and August. We\\'re feeling really good. I will note that the current, the most recent performance has been helped by a few factors. One, as we ramped up pretty quickly, some of our competitors have not opened or just first entering the market.</p> <p>Second, as we add staff, we\\'ve been rolling fully into it as we reopen. So as staffing levels come back on and more competition, we expect margins to come back more toward historical normal. But that said, we feel really good about this business and its future and its opportunities.</p><p><strong>Mark FitzPatrick</strong> -- <em>Executive Vice President and Chief Financial Officer</em></p> <p>Andy, it\\'s Mark. I thought I\\'ll just jump in and add a little bit more color on Hakkasan\\'s results in the quarter. During the quarter, Hakkasan contributed approximately $28 million of revenue, which represented 40% of Tao\\'s total revenue of approximately $70 million. So clearly, it was a significant contributor for the quarter.</p> <p>I\\'d also point out that we completed the acquisition on April 27, so that\\'s about two months of contribution in the quarter. While we\\'re not providing historical financials on Hakkasan, Tao\\'s business, including Hakkasan, is currently performing above its historical run rate for AOI. And while we expect that to normalize over time, we also see a lot of opportunity now that Hakkasan is under the Tao umbrella in areas such as expansion and brand development as well as potential cost savings in functions such as marketing and procurement. I hope that\\'s helpful.</p> <p>Thanks, Paul.</p><p><strong>Operator</strong></p><p>Your next question is from David Katz of Jefferies.</p><p><strong>David Katz</strong> -- <em>Jefferies -- Analyst</em></p> <p>Hi. Good morning, everyone. Thanks for taking my questions. I appreciate all the outlook information you\\'ve given.</p> <p>If we take a qualitative longer-term look beyond fiscal \\'22, what can you share with us about up, down or sideways as we go out just a little bit longer term on the recovery?</p><p><strong>Andy Lustgarten</strong> -- <em>President</em></p> <p>David, it\\'s Andy. Thank you. So as we -- I think you should start at a certain beginning, right? And so as we talked about, our booking calendar for \\'22 is -- we think is very strong or it could be very strong. Now this is driven by two factors, as we\\'ve discussed before, right? First is we\\'ve had all the shows that were supposed to be played off or scheduled -- rescheduled into this year as well as all the new apps coming online.</p> <p>So starting September, we\\'re going to see a pretty big ramp-up in our shows. What that\\'s done is the rest of the artists who wanted to be on the road this year are now going to have to look for dates for longer further out. So while historically, we would have been make it six months, nine months, maybe one year to start seeing holds, we\\'re seeing much longer than we\\'ve ever seen historically. This is across all of our venues, but particularly at the arena, where our holds are up 50% versus the last pre-pandemic year.</p> <p>So it gives us -- this tells us there\\'s real demand for artists to be on the road. We feel even further confident in this by -- after listening to Live Nation\\'s recent public comments, where they talk about the touring business for the years to come. Live Nation has a different purview than we do because they\\'re buying global tours and mapping them out at the right time. So while we speak directly to artists, they\\'re speaking to whole tours.</p> <p>Together between what we\\'re seeing and what we\\'re hearing from artists and what we\\'re hearing from Live Nation, we feel really good about not only this fiscal year but what the future could be for the next few. Thank you.</p><p><strong>David Katz</strong> -- <em>Jefferies -- Analyst</em></p> <p>Perfect. And if I can just follow up. I know you\\'ve talked about the sports betting or the mobile gaming opportunity. And I just want to be clear about where you are, how you\\'re positioned.</p> <p>I mean it\\'s obvious what assets you bring to it. But it sounds as though you\\'re sort of having discussions with a wide range of people so that you have irons and as many irons in the fire as possible, rather than sort of joining a group and formally submitting a bid. Is that a fair characterization?</p><p><strong>Andy Lustgarten</strong> -- <em>President</em></p> <p>So -- well, it\\'s twofold. One, we didn\\'t submit an application to be an operator, right? So -- and that\\'s for a few reasons on it. One of them is just simply certain lead roles restrict your ability if you\\'re a direct operator to put up Knicks and Rangers games on your platform. So we didn\\'t think that made sense.</p> <p>In addition, as we\\'ve talked about, we\\'re talking to everybody. We think we\\'re the best way to any for any operator or operators to reach the market. We\\'ve got great relationships with the current market leaders through our current partnerships as well as ones that we -- new entrants that are coming in. So we think we\\'re in the best position once we know who\\'s been selected to help drive those businesses.</p> <p>We talked about the assets we have, we\\'re going to be able to blanket the market, and we\\'ll be able to do it better than any other partner could. And so we think that, that\\'s the right position for us to be in over the next short term as well the state works through the application process.\\xa0</p><p><strong>David Katz</strong> -- <em>Jefferies -- Analyst</em></p> <p>Got it. I agree. Thanks.\\xa0</p><p><strong>Ari Danes</strong> -- <em>Investor Relations</em></p> <p>Christie, we have time for one last caller.</p><p><strong>Operator</strong></p><p>Certainly. Your final question is from David Karnovsky of J.P. Morgan.</p><p><strong>Anna Lizzul</strong> -- <em>J.P. Morgan -- Analyst</em></p> <p>This is Anna Lizzul on for David Karnovsky. Thank you for the question. First, I was wondering if you could please quantify any cost synergies post-merger and what the time line to realize this would be.</p><p><strong>Mark FitzPatrick</strong> -- <em>Executive Vice President and Chief Financial Officer</em></p> <p>Sure. Thanks for the question. As we\\'ve talked about before, we expect to realize savings in three categories: taxes, operating expenses and interest payments. First, in terms of taxes, the merger allows for more efficient use of MSG Entertainment\\'s tax attributes with MSG Networks\\' near-term cash flow.</p> <p>As of June 30, MSG Entertainment had an NOL of approximately $505 million and the company expects in calendar \\'23 to accelerate the depreciation of approximately 35% of the capex related to the MSG Sphere in Las Vegas. Second, we anticipate realizing approximately $10 million in annual savings, primarily related to public company costs. And finally, we believe that the merger enhances our ability to optimize our capital structure and lower interest payments. For example, we plan to explore refinancing MSG Entertainment\\'s term loan, which is callable on May.</p> <p>As of June 30, there was approximately $647 million outstanding on the loan, and it carries an interest rate of 7%. So we think there are some really attractive financial aspects of the transaction.</p><p><strong>Anna Lizzul</strong> -- <em>J.P. Morgan -- Analyst</em></p> <p>Thank you. And for the Las Vegas Sphere, is there any update you can provide in terms of how you\\'re thinking about original content for the venue?</p><p><strong>Andy Lustgarten</strong> -- <em>President</em></p> <p>Sure. It\\'s Andy. Let me start at the top, right? We\\'ve talked about it before but I think it\\'s really important to lay the groundwork. The Sphere is going to be an entirely new medium.</p> <p>It will be the first of its kind large-scale venue to be fully immersive for 17,500 people all at the same time. This venue\\'s going to use multisensory technologies, a high-resolution display screen, larger than the size of three football fields will come up, wrap around and engulf the whole audience. They\\'ll use the world largest beamforming audio system. That will utilize more than 180,000 speakers to deliver a truly unique listening experience for our guests.</p> <p>In addition, haptic seating which will enable the audience to feel what\\'s happening. There\\'ll be other 40 technologies to really complete the immersive experience. And as you know, we lengthened our construction time line. We\\'ve taken that time to really work on developing both our technologies as well as our original content.</p> <p>So in terms of the content that will be played in the Sphere, there will be multiple different types of events. There\\'ll be original attractions, as we just mentioned, concerts, corporate events and select sporting events. And right now, we\\'re taking the time to speak with key creators as we think about what our first show will look like. So we look forward to sharing more as we get closer to our opening date in 2023.</p> <p>Thank you.</p><p><strong>Operator</strong></p><p>Thank you. I will now turn the call back over to Ari Danes for any additional or closing remarks.</p><p><strong>Ari Danes</strong> -- <em>Investor Relations</em></p> <p>Thank you all for joining us. We look forward to speaking with you on our next earnings call. Have a good day.</p><p><strong>Operator</strong></p><p>[Operator signoff]</p> <p><strong>Duration: 39 minutes</strong></p><h2>Call participants:</h2><p><strong>Ari Danes</strong> -- <em>Investor Relations</em></p><p><strong>Andy Lustgarten</strong> -- <em>President</em></p><p><strong>Andrea Greenberg</strong> -- <em>President and Chief Executive Officer</em></p><p><strong>Mark FitzPatrick</strong> -- <em>Executive Vice President and Chief Financial Officer</em></p><p><strong>Brandon Ross</strong> -- <em>LightShed Partners -- Analyst</em></p><p><strong>John Janedis</strong> -- <em>Wolfe Research -- Analyst</em></p><p><strong>Paul Golding</strong> -- <em>Macquarie Capital -- Analyst</em></p><p><strong>David Katz</strong> -- <em>Jefferies -- Analyst</em></p><p><strong>Anna Lizzul</strong> -- <em>J.P.

      "             Thank you, and good morning, everyone. While we're clearly operating in a very fluid environment, we successfully navigated through one of the most challenging times in our company's history and remain cautiously optimistic about the road ahead. Looking back at fiscal 2021, we saw a number of positives, and I'm proud of the role we played in helping to shepherd the return of live entertainment in New York as our venues hosted the city's first large-scale events since the start of pandemic. Tao Group did their part as well, helping to bring back the critically important hospitality industry, while returning to profitability in the June quarter.\n",
      "            </p>\n",
      "            <p>\n",
      "             And with the acquisition of Hakkasan Group in April, we believe Tao is well positioned to build on its track record of success. We also continued to make meaningful progress on our next chapter, MSG Sphere in Las Vegas, heading toward the venues opening in calendar 2023. And in early July, our acquisition of MSG Networks created a company with greater scale and revenue diversity as well as enhanced financial flexibility. This was all accomplished during a very difficult year when our performance venues and Tao Group properties were largely closed or operating with significant restrictions and both the Christmas Spectacular and Boston Calling Music Festivals were canceled.\n",
      "            </p>\n",
      "            <p>\n",
      "             We've talked throughout the year about the important steps we took during this uncertain period, including reductions in our spending, lengthening our construction timetable for MSG Sphere in Las Vegas and completing a $650 million debt raise. These actions strengthened our balance sheet, while protecting our core entertainment business. And while conditions have improved, we continue to monitor what's happening in our markets. This includes New York City's announcement earlier this month that while venues can continue to welcome people at 100% capacity, all guests who are dining indoors or attending indoor performances are required to show proof of at least one vaccination shot, which we think is beneficial for our businesses.\n",
      "            </p>\n",
      "            <div class=\"interad\">\n",

      "            <p>\n",
      "             We operate in the New York market, which already has one of the highest vaccination rates in the country, and our research indicates that our fans in this market prefer attending vaccinated events. We saw this firsthand during the fourth quarter, starting with the sold-out Knicks playoff games, where we hosted nearly 90% vaccinated crowds as well as across a number of concerts, which were sold at 100% capacity to all vaccinated audiences. Looking forward, we have begun to staff up in anticipation of what we envision could be a busy year ahead. While we're mindful of what's happening with the Delta variant, including the cancellation of certain shows around the country, we think that vaccination policies that are increasingly being adopted by cities, including New York as well as companies in our industry, will be helpful.\n",
      "            </p>\n",
      "            <p>\n",
      "             We currently expect concert touring to begin ramping back up in late September, leading to a strong concert booking schedule on a full-year basis. In fact, fiscal 2022 is currently pacing ahead of fiscal 2020, which as you may recall, was slated to be a record bookings year for our company prior to the onset of the pandemic. In addition, we continue to see enthusiastic levels of consumer demand through strong sales as new shows get announced. And Christmas in New York is back.\n",
      "            </p>\n",
      "            <p>\n",
      "             Last month, we announced that tickets are officially on sale for the 2021 season of the Christmas Spectacular production. We are pleased with the early sales for the season's 163-show run and are looking forward to the production's return. We also recently entered into a long-term lease renewal with favorable terms for Radio City Music Hall, which extends our lease until 2038, with an option to renew for an additional 10 years. We are pleased to have worked with Tishman Speyer on this agreement, which is a win-win for all parties involved as it ensures this landmark venue remains home of the Christmas Spectacular for many years to come.\n",

      "            <p>\n",
      "             Turning to Tao Group. Fourth-quarter results include the impact of the Hakkasan Group acquisition, which created a global leader in premium hospitality with over 60 venues across five continents. The acquisition expands Tao's U.S. presence in major entertainment markets, such as Las Vegas, Southern California and Miami, while providing instant international foothold in destinations like London and the Middle East.\n",
      "            </p>\n",
      "            <p>\n",
      "             This increased footprint also provides local expertise to support further expansion. Another area where Hakkasan will help drive the business is through its expertise in licensing, which Tao intends to utilize alongside its owned and managed venue models as it continues to pursue growth opportunities. The easing of capacity restrictions in the fourth quarter helped drive strong results for Tao, with the majority of its revenue and AOI generated in the month of June. In addition, the best-performing market for the quarter was Las Vegas, where Tao's presence, which has significantly expanded with the Hakkasan acquisition, will be important to MSG Sphere at The Venetian.\n",

      "             We made meaningful progress on MSG Sphere this past fiscal year, achieving a significant milestone in June when we completed the structural steel for the main venue. Over the next 12 months, we intend to complete the roof concrete and the venue's exterior facade as we continue to make progress on the interior build-out and pedestrian bridge. We also plan to move forward with the buildings with building MSG Sphere's exosphere, the spherical structure that will surround the venue and eventually be covered with 580,000 square feet of fully programmable LED lighting. This impactful exterior display is just one of the ways customers will interact with MSG Sphere content.\n",

      "            <p>\n",
      "             Inside the venue is where we will use state-of-the-art technologies to create first-of-their-kind immersive experiences. And this coming year, we'll increase our focus on developing this content for Sphere. Before I turn things over to Andrea, I'd like to spend a moment on the emerging opportunity around mobile sports gaming. New York State's application process is expected to conclude by early January.\n",
      "            </p>\n",
      "            <p>\n",
      "             Many of the leading online sports betting operators are participating in the process, which creates a competitive market that we believe bodes well for us. From entertainment and media assets that reach millions to potential fixed venue-based opportunities that include The Garden and Tao locations, we believe we're one of the best positioned companies to help partners succeed in connecting with consumers. We continue to be in active discussions with many of the potential market participants and are increasingly bullish about this opportunity for our company. In summary, while we know we're in a fluid environment, we're optimistic about the year ahead due to the strong pent-up demand we saw at our entertainment and Tao businesses in June, which has continued so far this summer; our progress with MSG Sphere in Las Vegas; and the powerful platform we have created with MSG Networks, which brings together our entertainment and media assets and positions us well for future opportunities.\n",

      "             During fiscal 2021, we were also reminded once again of the power and popularity of live sports, following the return of the NBA and NHL for their shortened 2021 regular seasons. We saw ratings strength on our linear networks, including double-digit percentage increases in average household ratings for the Knicks, Rangers and Islanders regular seasons. We also saw all-time highs for viewership and engagement on MSG GO, our authenticated live streaming app. This strong performance continued into the post season, with ratings for the Knicks and Islanders' first-round matchups well exceeding each team's regular season averages.\n",

And as we move forward in an evolving media landscape, we remain committed to building on our history of innovation to create value for our partners and viewers. We will continue to experiment with new types of content, including alternative versions of our live game telecast and explore new ways to monetize our media rights and content library through both new and complementary product offerings. We also will remain focused on interactivity, where we've seen firsthand with our MSG GO app, the benefits of interactive games on engagement and frequency of tune.\n",

This data also makes us an even more valuable marketing partner, including in the emerging world of mobile sports gaming with a significant number of opportunities for MSG Networks, including everything from branded content to integrations on our mobile apps. We're excited about the future and are confident in our ability to continue to innovate and effectively monetize our content, which we believe will ultimately help us drive robust ongoing adjusted operating income.

Let me start by reviewing our fourth-quarter financial performance, which as a reminder, does not include the results of MSG Networks as the acquisition was completed on July 9. That said, MSG Networks' stand-alone results can be found in our press release. And beginning next quarter, we will speak to this segment's results in detail.\n",

      "             In the fiscal fourth quarter, we generated revenues of $99.8 million and had an adjusted operating loss of $70 million. In terms of revenue, Tao Group generated $69.7 million. These results included the addition of Hakkasan at the end of April, and as Andy noted, were driven by strong reopening in our key markets, especially in Las Vegas. Revenue also included the impact of our various commercial arrangements with MSG Sports, including $8.3 million in arena license fees as the Knicks and Rangers concluded the regular seasons at The Garden in May, followed by three sold-out Knicks home playoff games.\n",

      "            <p>\n",
      "             In addition, revenue was positively impacted by both live events and ad sales commissions from MSG Networks. Looking ahead to fiscal 2022, we'd like to highlight a few items. First, we've started to strategically hire across our Entertainment segment to support the anticipated ramp-up of live events starting in late September. We also are working to fully staff our Tao venues to match the reopening momentum at restaurants and nightclubs.\n",

      "             Second, we plan to increase our content development and technology investments related to our Sphere initiative. And finally, at MSG Networks, we're anticipating full NBA and NHL seasons, and therefore expect to return to more normalized levels for certain expenses, such as rights fees and normalized advertising revenue. Now let's turn to capital expenditures. We had $130.5 million of capital expenditures in the fiscal fourth quarter, which primarily related to the construction of MSG Sphere in Las Vegas.\n",

As a reminder, last quarter, we announced that the cost estimate for the venue was approximately 10% higher than our previously announced estimate of $1.66 billion. As planned, during our recent annual budget process, we thoroughly reviewed the cost, scope and timeline of the project and have refined our project cost estimate to be approximately $1.865 billion. As construction manager, we will continue to aggressively manage all aspects of the project and are excited for the venues opening in calendar 2023.\n",

In terms of debt, the combined company's debt balance was approximately $1.74 billion as of year end. As previously noted, we believe that the merger allows us to optimize our capital structure, including the potential opportunistic refinancing of MSG Entertainment's $647 million term loan, which was put in place during the pandemic last November and carries an interest rate of 7%.\n",

In that one, they thought there would be over $900 million of net gross tax revenue generated for the state, and that includes money for marketing.

      "             I'll say that we're really excited about it. It's pretty transformative for Tao or Tao-Hakkasan business. In terms of size, rough order, it nearly doubled Tao's revenue base based on 2019 results and it expands Tao's footprint, both here in the U.S. and key international markets such as the U.K., London, specifically Middle East.\n",

      "             We think Tao's management team is the best in the industry and they built up a great infrastructure for growth. Both of those will help drive the operational efficiencies that we expect to achieve here at Hakkasan. This will be believed or added to by the economy of scale as we see across both businesses working together, marketing efforts, procurement should drive this business. And in addition, Hakkasan and Tao, while very similar in terms of operating, there were some nuances in how they do in deal structure.\n",

      "            <p>\n",
      "             Both have lease venues, but in addition, Tao really has more of an expertise in managed venues, which means manage for somebody else, higher -- a little bit lower revenue, but a big piece of profit and a higher margin. So we will look to those structures at the right time for Hakkasan brands. And vice versa, Hakkasan is very strong in licensing. And so we will look for Tao to capitalize on Hakkasan's licensing expertise to enter markets that we may never would have entered on our own as operating.\n",

One, as we ramped up pretty quickly, some of our competitors have not opened or just first entering the market.\n",

      "             Andy, it's Mark. I thought I'll just jump in and add a little bit more color on Hakkasan's results in the quarter. During the quarter, Hakkasan contributed approximately $28 million of revenue, which represented 40% of Tao's total revenue of approximately $70 million. So clearly, it was a significant contributor for the quarter.\n",

      "             I'd also point out that we completed the acquisition on April 27, so that's about two months of contribution in the quarter. While we're not providing historical financials on Hakkasan, Tao's business, including Hakkasan, is currently performing above its historical run rate for AOI. And while we expect that to normalize over time, we also see a lot of opportunity now that Hakkasan is under the Tao umbrella in areas such as expansion and brand development as well as potential cost savings in functions such as marketing and procurement. I hope that's helpful.\n",

What that's done is the rest of the artists who wanted to be on the road this year are now going to have to look for dates for longer further out. So while historically, we would have been make it six months, nine months, maybe one year to start seeing holds, we're seeing much longer than we've ever seen historically. This is across all of our venues, but particularly at the arena, where our holds are up 50% versus the last pre-pandemic year.\n",

At this time, for opening remarks and introductions, I would like to turn the call over Nancy Paxton, Senior Director of Investor Relations. Please go ahead, ma'am.\", 'Nancy Paxton,  Apple Inc. - Senior Director of IR    [2]', \"Thank you. Good afternoon, and thanks to everyone for joining us today. Speaking first is Apple's CEO, Tim Cook, and he'll be followed by CFO, Luca Maestri. After that, we'll open the call to questions from analysts.\", \"Please note that some of the information you'll hear during our discussion will consist of forward-looking statements, including without limitation, those regarding revenue, growth margins, operating expenses, other income and expense, taxes, future business outlook, and plans for capital return and debt issuance. Actual results or trends could differ materially from our forecast.\", 'For more information, please refer to the risk factors discussed in Apples Form 10-K for 2015, the Form 10-Q for the first quarter of FY16, and the Form 8-K filed with the SEC today, along with the Associated Press release. Apple assumes no obligation to update any forward-looking statements or information, which speak as of their respective date.', \"In addition, today's comments will refer to a metric we describe as the purchase value of services tied to our installed base. This is a non-GAAP measure, and a reconciliation to the corresponding GAAP measure can be found on our investor relations website at Apple.com/investor. I'd now like to turn the call over to Tim for introductory remarks.\", 'Tim Cook,  Apple Inc. - CEO    [3]', \"Thanks, Nancy, and good afternoon, everyone, and thank you for joining us. Today, we're reporting the results of a very busy and challenging quarter, and we're also announcing an update to our capital return program.\", 'Revenue for the quarter was $50.6 billion, which was within our guidance range. Despite the pause in our growth, our results reflect excellent execution by our team in the face of ongoing macroeconomic headwinds in much of the world, and difficult year-over-year comparisons.', 'We saw continued currency weakness in the vast majority of our international markets. In constant currency, our revenue declined by 9% from last year, 400 basis points less than the reported decline of 13%. For the first half of the fiscal year, our revenue in constant currency was up 1% year-on-year.', 'Despite challenges, there were a number of encouraging signs during the quarter. Our installed base of over 1 billion active devices continued to grow strongly. We added a huge number of Android switchers and new-to-Mac customers, and we generated very strong growth from services.', 'We sold 51.2 million iPhones in the quarter, consistent with the range of our own expectations, but lower than the exceptional year-ago quarter, when we saw an acceleration in iPhone upgrades, and 40% iPhone sales growth over the previous year. To provide some additional color, iPhone sales come from three sources: Customers who upgrade from previous iPhone models, customers who switch from Android and other operating systems, and customers who purchase a smart phone for the first time.', 'As we look at each of these three sources of iPhone sales, we see a business that is healthy and strong. First, from an upgrade perspective, during the first half of this year, the upgrade rate for the iPhone 6s cycle has been slightly higher than what we experienced in the iPhone 5s cycle two years ago, but it is lower than the accelerated upgrade rate we saw with iPhone 6, which as you know, was a big contributor to our phenomenal revenue growth a year ago. Most importantly, our customers are incredibly loyal. A recent Kantar survey of US smart phone purchasers indicated a 95% iPhone loyalty rate, the highest ever measured for any smart phone.', 'Second, we continued to see a very high level of customers switching to iPhone from Android and other operating systems. In fact, we added more switchers from Android and other platforms in the first half of this year than any other six-month period ever.', 'And third, with only 42% smart phone penetration of the global handset market today, iPhone is still attracting millions of first-time smart phone buyers each quarter, especially from emerging markets. For example, in India, our iPhone sales were up 56% from a year ago.', \"Next, I'd like to talk about services, which was our second-largest revenue generating category during the quarter. Setting aside the amount we received from a patent settlement in the December quarter, the March quarter services revenue was our highest ever. Services revenue jumped 20% to $6 billion. App Store revenue was up 35% to beat last quarter's all-time record, and Apple Music continues to grow in popularity with over 13 million paying subscribers today. We feel really great about the early success of Apple's first subscription business, and our Music revenue has now hit an inflection point after many quarters of decline.\", 'The services business is powered by our huge installed base of active device, which crossed 1 billion units earlier this year. As we discussed on this call in January, those 1 billion-plus active devices are a source of recurring revenue that is growing independent of the unit shipments we report every three months. In fact, the purchase value of services tied to our installed base was a record $9.9 billion in the March quarter, up 27% over last year, accelerating from the 24% growth rate we reported in the December quarter.', \"The reach of Apple Pay also continues to expand, following a very successful launch in China in the March quarter, and last week's roll-out in Singapore. Apple Pay is growing at a tremendous rate, with more than 5 times the transaction volume of a year ago, and 1 million new users per week. There are more than 10 million contactless ready locations in the countries where Apple Pay has launched today, including over 2.5 million locations now accepting Apple Pay in the United States, and more expansion of Apple Pay is coming soon.\", \"Turning to the Mac, we met our sell-in expectations, in addition to reducing channel inventory by about 100,000 unites. Overall, the Mac continues to attract  a large percentage of new customers. In our latest survey of major markets, over half of buyers were new to the Mac, and in some countries, the percentage is extremely high, like in China, where over 80% of customers were purchasing a Mac for the first time. We're confident in our Mac business, and our ability to continue to innovate and gain share in that area.\", 'Turning to the Apple Watch, unit sales met our expectations in the quarter. For some color on how we think about Apple Watch sales, we expected seasonality to be similar to the historical seasonality of iPod, which typically generated 40% or more of its annual unit sell-through in the December  quarter.', 'We started shipping Apple  Watch just one year ago, and it has quickly become the best-selling and most loved smart watch in the world. In fact, unit sales of Apple Watch during its first year exceeded sales of iPhone in its first year. Last month, we refreshed the lineup for the spring with new bands and a new starting price point, and the response from customers has been great.', \"Apple Watch is an increasingly essential part of user's lives, from responding to messages, managing calendars and navigating with maps, to helping them  be more fit. And in some cases, the heart rate sensor has even helped save lives. We're really excited about the first year with Apple Watch. We have learned a lot, and we believe it has an exciting future ahead.\", \"We announced some fantastic new products during the March quarter. iPhone SE became available on March 31, so none of its sales were reflected in our second-quarter results, but so far this quarter, we're seeing terrific customer response. iPhone SE is the most powerful four-inch phone ever, and it's a great option for customers all over the world who want a compact phone with advanced features, and a great price, without compromising performance. Demand has been very strong, and exceeds supply at this point, but we're working hard to get the iPhone SE into the hands of every customer who wants one, as quickly as possible. The addition of the iPhone SE in the iPhone lineup places us in a better strategic position to attract even more customers into our ecosystem.\", 'We also unveiled the stunning 9.7 inch iPad Pro, with cutting-edge performance and our most advanced display yet. The reviews of our new iPad Pros have been great, and we are hearing from customers of the features and capabilities in the new Pros make them both the ultimate upgrade for iPad owners, and a great PC replacement.', 'In the June quarter, we expect to see our best iPad revenue compare in over two years. iPad is the best-selling, best-reviewed and  most used tablet on the market. Customers tell us that they love iPad for its unique mix of portability, capability, and versatility, with over 1 million iPad apps in the App Store to help them work, play, learn, and create.', \"We also announced Care Kit, a new software framework that developers can use to help people take a more active role in their health, by keeping track of their care plans, monitoring their symptoms and medication, and delivering the insights they need to make smart decisions about their health. We're very excited about the ways iPhone and Apple Watch are helping people lead healthier lives. We believe there's great promise here for the future, and we are very interested in where this can take us.\", 'As always, we are contributing to society beyond our products, promoting the use of renewable energy across our facilities and inside our supply chain, and developing cutting-edge technologies to revolutionize recycling in the materials we use. We are unwavering in our commitment to protect the security and privacy of our customers and their data, and we are actively promoting inclusion and equality across our business.', \"As we continue through the June quarter, I'd like to remind you that we measure the health of customer demand based on sell-through. Despite ending Q2 within our channel inventory targets, in light of the macroeconomic environment we plan to lower our channel inventories in the June quarter. This will impact our reported revenue in Q3. Luca will provide more details on this in his commentary.\", 'But before turning over the call to him, I will summarize by saying that the future of Apple is very bright. Our product pipeline has amazing innovations in store. We are very excited about bringing together developers for our four major platforms at our worldwide developers conference in June.', \"We are forging ahead with important investments in research and development, in our infrastructure, and in our supply chain. We've made 15 acquisitions in the last four quarters to accelerate our product and services roadmaps, and we are always on the lookout for companies with great technology, talent, and strategic fit.\", \"Creating value for shareholders by developing great products and services that enrich people's lives will always be our top priority, and the key factor driving our investments and capital allocation decisions. As our business continues to generate high levels of free cash flow, we are in the fortunate position to expand our capital return program again this year, as we have done each year since we started the program four years ago.\", 'Today, we are announcing an extension of the timeframe of the program by four quarters through March of 2018, and we are expanding the total program size from $200 billion to $250 billion. Luca has more details on this announcement and our results for the March quarter. Luca?', 'Luca Maestri,  Apple Inc. - CFO    [4]', 'Thank you, Tim, and good afternoon, everyone. Let me start with the March quarter results. Revenue for the quarter landed within our guidance range at $50.6 billion, compared to $58 billion in the year-ago quarter, a decline of 13%.', 'As we had expected, our comparisons to last year were influenced by the continued strength of the US dollar against foreign currencies. That being said, in constant currency, our revenue declined by 9%. On a geographic basis, in Asia, our revenue grew strongly in Japan, but it declined in greater China and the rest of Asia-Pacific.', 'However our business in these two regions is faring better than the numbers might suggest. We had significant channel inventory reductions and currency weakness, which affected our reported revenue for both of these segments. In mainland China, revenue was down 11%, and the decline was 7% in constant currency terms. Keep in mind that we were up against an extremely difficult year-ago compare, when our mainland China revenue grew 81%. We remain very optimistic about the China market over the long-term, and we are committed to investing there for the long run.', 'Gross margin was 39.4%, near the high-end of our guidance range, thanks to strong cost performance. Operating margin was 27.7% of revenue, and net income was $10.5 billion. Diluted earnings per share were $1.90, and cash flow from operations was strong, at $11.6 billion.', 'For details by product, I start with iPhone. We sold 51.2 million iPhones in the quarter, compared to 61.2 million in the year-ago quarter, a decline of 16%. It was a particularly challenging comparison to the record quarter a year ago, when iPhone 6 grew 40% as we entered last March quarter, and supply demand imbalance, which was recovered during the quarter.', 'Also, this year we reduced channel inventory by 450,000 units, while we increased inventory by 1 million units a year ago. We have exited the quarter with in our five to seven-week target range for channel  inventory. iPhone ASV was $642 compared to $659 in the year ago quarter, with weak international currencies and very popular mid-tier and entry offerings contributing to the difference year-over-year.', \"iPhone's momentum in business markets continues to be very impressive. A recent survey by 451 Research, formerly known as ChangeWave, found that among US corporate buyers planning to purchase smart phones in the June quarter, 78% planned to purchase iPhones. That's the highest June quarter iPhone purchase intent ever measured by the survey and 5 points higher than a year ago.\", 'Turning to services, we generated $6 billion in revenue, an increase of 20% over the March quarter last year, thanks primarily to the continued strong performance of the App Store, with revenue growing 35% to a new all-time high. According to App Annie, the App Store generated 90% more global revenue than Google Play in the March quarter, up from a 75% lead in 2015. Among our customers who purchased apps and content from our iTunes Stores, the average amount spent per customer reached a new all-time record in the March quarter.', \"Next, I'd like to talk about the Mac. We sold 4 million Macs compared to 4.6 million last year, a decline of 12%. It was a challenging quarter for personal computer sales across the industry, but we believe we gained market share. Despite the overall market slowdown, we generated double-digit market growth in a number of markets, including Russia, Korea, Singapore, Taiwan, and the UAE.\", 'Just last week, we updated the MacBook, our thinnest and lightest Mac, with the latest processors, faster graphics, fastest flash storage, and longer battery life. We think our customers are going to love this update. We ended the quarter within our four to five-week target range for Mac channel inventory.', 'Turning to iPad, we sold 10.3 million compared to 12.6 million in the year ago quarter. We also reduced channel inventory by about 200,000 units, and we exited the quarter within our five to seven-week target range. In the same segments of the public market where we compete, we continue to be highly successful. Recent data from NPD indicates that iPad had 78% share of the US market for tablets priced above $200. And the latest data published by ABC indicates that iPad accounts for 72% of the US commercial tablet market, comprising business, government, and education.', 'iPad customer metrics are also extremely positive. In February, 451 Research measured a 97% consumer satisfaction rate for iPad Air 2, and among consumers planning to purchase a tablet within the next six months, 59% planned to purchase an iPad, more than 3 times the purchase intention rate of the next highest brand measured. Corporate buyers reported a 94% satisfaction rate for iPad, and a June quarter purchase intent of 71%.', 'Revenue from other products grew 30% over the last year, thanks to Apple Watch. We have expanded distribution to 60 countries, and introduced bands in beautiful new colors for spring, so customers can personalize their watches in more ways, with a range of colors, styles, and materials. Our customers are very happy with Apple Watch, with 451 Research measuring 94% customer satisfaction.', \"We're also making great progress with our enterprise initiatives. IBM now has engagements for more than 200 deployments of native iOS apps for large enterprise customers to accelerate mobile transformation. Our mobility partner program also continues to grow, with 108 partners across 20 countries.\", 'We see continued broad industry adoption of native iOS apps to transform how professionals do their work and serve their customers. For example, retail bankers are using iOS apps on iPads to greet and onboard customers, reduce queue times, and improve the customer experience. And in hospitals, using doctors and nurses are using iOS Apps on iPhone and iPad to share and communicate more effectively, so that they can spend more time with patients, and less time on administrative tasks.', 'Let me now turn to our cash positions. We ended the quarter with $232.9 billion in cash plus marketable securities, a sequential increase of $17.2 billion. $208.9 billion of this cash, or 90% of the total, was outside the United States.', 'We issued $15.5 billion in US dollar denominated notes during the quarter, including our first green bond tranche to fund initiatives such as renewable energy and environmental design projects. We exited the March quarter with $72 billion in term debt. We returned   $10 billion to investors during the quarter, including $2.9 billion in dividends and equivalents, and $7 billion on purchases of 71.8 million Apple shares, to open market transactions.', \"We have now completed over $163 billion of the current $200 billion capital return program, including $117 billion in share repurchases. As Tim mentioned, today we are announcing the latest update to our program, which we are increasing to a total of $250 billion. Once again, we are allocating the majority of the expansion of the program to share repurchases, given our strong confidence in Apple's future, and the value we see in our stock. The Board has increased the share repurchase authorization by $35 billion, raising it from the current $140 billion level to $175 billion. We will also continue to net share settle, less the employee restricted stock units.\", 'We also know that the dividend is very important to many of our investors who value income, and we are raising it for the fourth time in less than four years. The quarterly dividend will grow from $0.52 per share to $0.57 per share, an increase of about 10%. This is effective with our next dividend, which the Board has declared today is payable on May 12, 2016, to shareholders of record as of May 9, 2016.', 'We continue to plan for annual dividend increases going forward. With $12 billion in annual dividend payments, we are proud to be one of the largest dividend payers in the world. In total, with this updated program, during the next eight quarters, we expect to return $87 billion to our investors, which represents about 15% of our market cap at the current stock price.', 'As in the past, we expect to fund our capital return program with US cash, future US cash flow generation and borrowing from both domestic and international debt markets. We will continue to review capital allocation regularly, and solicit input on our program from a broad base of shareholders. This allows us to be thoughtful about the size, the mix, and the face of the program.', \"As we move ahead into the June quarter, I'd like to review our outlook, which includes the types of forward-looking information that Nancy referred to at the beginning of the call. We expect revenue to be between $41 billion and $43 billion. The revenue guidance implies a year-over-year decline, as we lap an incredibly strong June quarter last year, when revenue grew 33%, due in part to accelerated iPhone upgrade purchases. This tough compare is compounded by the continued weak macro environment this year, and the strong US dollar, which affects our revenue growth in international markets.\", 'Embedded in this guidance is a planned channel inventory reduction worth  over $2 billion, as we have elected to be prudent about our channel inventory position, given the current macro environment. The guidance also reflects a range of possible scenarios related to how quickly we can get into supply-demand balance for iPhone SE. Due to these factors, our expected demand is greater than the revenue range implies.', \"Sequentially, our guidance implies a revenue decline of 15% to 19%, which is comparable to the 17% sequential decline that we've averaged from the March to June quarter for the last three years, despite the anticipated channel inventory adjustments I just described. We expect seasonal sequential declines in iPhone and iPad sales, and a sequential increase in Mac sales. We also expect iPhone ASPs to decline sequentially as we get further from the launch of iPhone 6s and 6s Plus, and as iPhone SE enters the mix.\", 'We know that our revenue guidance falls short of market estimates for the third quarter. We believe the difference counts primarily from three areas: First, the $2 billion plus channel inventory reduction I just mentioned. Second, the effect of the channel inventory reduction, and the launch of iPhone SE on iPhone ASPs, as well as the current constrained supply of iPhone SE. Third, different estimates for Mac, which we expect to grow sequentially at the rate similar to what we have experienced in the past June quarters.', 'We expect gross margins to be between 37.5% and 38%. We expect continued cost improvements to be more than offset by the sequential loss of leverage from lower revenue, and a differing mix of products. We expect OpEx to be between $6 billion and $6.1 billion.', \"We expect OI&E to be about $300 million. And we expect the tax rate to be about 25.5%. With that, I'd like to open the call to questions.\", 'Nancy Paxton,  Apple Inc. - Senior Director of IR    [5]', 'Thank you, Luca.', '(Caller Instructions)', 'Operator, may we have the first question, please?', 'Questions and Answers', 'Operator    [1]', '(Operator Instructions)', 'First, we hear from Simona Jankowski with Goldman Sachs.', 'Simona Jankowski,  Goldman Sachs - Analyst    [2]', \"My first question was actually just a clarification, in terms of putting in context that $2 billion in channel inventory reduction. What was that last year, just to help us make the comparison on a year-over-year basis? The bigger question, Tim was, with the smart phone market now reaching a pretty mature growth base, how does Apple think of itself going forward? Is it a growth company, or is it a more mature tech company? And if it's still the former, how does that change how you think about M&A especially given the position you're in with your balance sheet strategically?\", 'Luca Maestri,  Apple Inc. - CFO    [3]', \"Simona, let me give you the data point on the sell through and then I'll let Tim answer the strategic question. We had a channel inventory reduction that was worth a bit less than $800 million a year ago.\", 'Tim Cook,  Apple Inc. - CEO    [4]', \"Simona, this is Tim. In terms of do I think the smart phone market is mature? I think that the market, as you know, is currently not growing. However, my view of that is that's an overhang of the macroeconomic environment in many different places in the world. We're very optimistic that this too shall pass, and that the market and particularly us will grow again.\", \"The reason that we're optimistic is we look at sort of the three places that iPhone sales come from, and from an upgrade point of view, as I mentioned in my comments, we compare favorably, slightly better than the upgrade cycle that we saw on the iPhone 5s. We are lower than the iPhone 6, but I think all of us know that was an extraordinary cycle, that accelerated upgrades from 2016 into 2015, and so that comparable will be tough for this year, but that's a transitory thing.\", \"As we look at switchers, we're extremely excited that for the first half we have set a record from switchers from other platforms. The largest we've ever seen in any six month period before, so we've got traction there. And then on emerging markets, if you take a look at India, we grew by 56%, and we're placing increasing emphasis in these areas, where it's clear there will be disproportionate growth versus the more developed areas.\", \"The next thing is with the iPhone SE, we have seen our ability to attract even more customers into the platform, with incredible product that is at a new price point for us, with the latest technology. And so we're optimistic about attracting even more customers with that. We also look at our pipeline, and were very excited about what's in our pipeline. All of those things make me optimistic.\", \"Your other question was on M&A, and regardless of the first, we're always looking in the market about things that could complement things that we do today, become features in something we to, or allow us to accelerate entry into a category that we are excited about. As I have said before, our test is not on the size. We would definitely buy something larger than we have bought thus far. It's more about the strategic fit, and whether it's  a great technology and great people. We continue to look, and we stay very active in the M&A market.\", 'Simona Jankowski,  Goldman Sachs - Analyst    [5]', 'Thank you.', 'Nancy Paxton,  Apple Inc. - Senior Director of IR    [6]', 'Thank you. Could we have the next question please?', 'Operator    [7]', \"From Piper Jaffray, we'll hear from Gene Munster.\", 'Gene Munster,  Piper Jaffray & Co. - Analyst    [8]', \"Good afternoon. Tim, can you talk a little bit about the iPhone ASP trends, and specifically you mentioned that the SE is going to impact, but how are you thinking about the aspirational market share that's out there, and your actual market share, and using price to close that gap? Is it just the SE or could there be other iPhone models that will be discounted, to try to be more aggressive in emerging markets?\", 'And one for Luca. Can you talk a little bit about the services segment, in terms of what piece of the services is driving growth, and maybe a little bit about the profitability on a net basis versus the growth basis that you  have referred to in the past. Thanks.', 'Tim Cook,  Apple Inc. - CEO    [9]', 'I think the SE is attracting two types of customers. One is   customers that wanted the latest technology, but wanted it in a more compact package. And we clearly see even more people than we thought in that category.', \"Secondly, it's attracting people aspire to own an iPhone, but couldn't quite stretch to the entry price of the iPhone, and we've established a new entry. I think both of these markets are very, very important to us, and we are really excited about where it can take us. I do think that we will be really happy with the new to iPhone customers that we see from here, because of the early returns we've had. We are currently supply constrained, but we'll be able to work our way out of this at some point. But it's great to see the overwhelming demand for it. I will let Luca comment on the ASPs.\", 'Luca Maestri,  Apple Inc. - CFO    [10]', 'On the ASPs, Gene we mentioned that we were going to be down sequentially, and this is really the combination of two factors. So when we go from the March quarter to the June quarter, is the fact that we are having the SE entering the mix, and that obviously is going to have a downward pressure on ASP, and also this channel inventory reduction that we have talked about, obviously the channel inventory reduction will come from higher-end models, and that is also affecting the sequential trend on ASPs.', \"The question on services, when we look at our services business, obviously growing very well across the board. The biggest element, and the part of the services business that is growing very well, we mentioned 35%, is the App Store. It's interesting for us that our music business, which had been declining for a number of quarters, now that we have both a download model and a streaming model, we have now hit an inflection point, and we believe that this would be the bottom, and we can start growing from there over time.\", \"We have many other services businesses that are doing very well, we have an iCloud business that is growing very quickly. Faster than the App Store, from a much lower base but I think it's important for us as we continue to develop these businesses. Tim have talked about Apple Pay. It doesn't provide a meaningful financial contribution at this point, but as we look at the amount of transactions that go into Apple Pay right now, and we think ahead for the long-term, that could be an interesting business for us, as well.\", \"From a profitability standpoint, we have mentioned last time that when you look at it on a gross basis, so in terms of purchase value of these services, the profitability of the business is similar to Company average. Of course, when you met out the amount that is paid to developers, and you look at it, in terms of what is reported in our P&L, obviously that business has a profitability that is higher than Company average. We don't get into the specifics of specific products or services, but it is very clear it is significantly higher than Company average.\", 'Gene Munster,  Piper Jaffray & Co. - Analyst    [11]', 'Thank you.', 'Nancy Paxton,  Apple Inc. - Senior Director of IR    [12]', 'Thanks, Gene. Could we have the next question please?', 'Operator    [13]', 'Katy Huberty with Morgan Stanley.', 'Katy Huberty,  Morgan Stanley - Analyst    [14]', 'Yes, thank you. First for Luca. This is the worst gross margin guide in a year and a half or so, and over the last couple of quarters, you have talked about number of tailwinds including component cost, the lower accounting deferrals that went into effect in September. You just mentioned the services margins are above corporate average. So the question is, are some of those tailwinds winding down? Or is a significant guide down in gross margin for the June quarter entirely related to volume and the 5 SE? And then I have a follow-up for Tim.', 'Luca Maestri,  Apple Inc. - CFO    [15]', \"Katy, clearly the commodity environment remains quite favorable, and we continue to expect cost improvements. The other dynamics that you have mentioned are still there, obviously what is different, and particularly as we look at it on a sequential basis coming out of the March quarter, we would have loss of leverage, and that obviously is going to have a negative impact on margins. The other factor that's important to keep in mind is this different mix of products.\", \"Particularly when you look at iPhone, what I was mentioning to Gene earlier, I think we've got a couple of things that are affecting not only ASPs, but obviously, they also affects margins. And it's the fact that we have a channel inventory reduction at the top end of the range, and we've got the introduction of the iPhone SE at the entry level of the range. And so when you take into account those factors, those are the big elements that drive our guidance range right now.\", 'Katy Huberty,  Morgan Stanley - Analyst    [16]', 'Okay. Thank you. And that a question for Tim, appreciate the optimism around longer-term iPhone unit growth, but with developed market penetration in anywhere from 60% to 80%, the growth is going to have to come from new markets. You talked about India. Could you just spend a little bit more time on that market? What are some of the hurdles you have to overcome, for that to be a larger part of the business? When we expect Apple to have more distribution, and specifically your own stores in that country? Thanks.', 'Tim Cook,  Apple Inc. - CEO    [17]', \"Katy, in the short term, let me just make a couple of comments on the developed markets, just to make sure this is clear. If you look at our installed base of iPhone today versus two years ago, it's increased by 80%. When you think about upgrade cycles, upgrade cycles would have varying rates on it. As I talked about on the comments, the iPhone 6s rate, upgrade rate is slightly higher than the iPhone 5s, but lower than the iPhone 6.\", \"But the other multiplier in that equation is obviously the size of the installed base. The net of the idea is that I think there's still really, really good business in the developed markets, so I wouldn't want to write those off. It's our job to come up with great products that people desire, and also to continue to attract over Android switchers. With our worldwide share there's still quite a bit of room in the developed markets, as well.\", 'From an India point of view, if you look at India, and each country has a different story a bit, but the things that have held not only us back, perhaps, but some others as well, is that the LTE rollout with India just really begins this year. So we will begin to see some really good networks coming on in India. That will unleash the power and capability of the iPhone, in a way that an older network, 2.5G or even some 3G networks, would not do. The infrastructure is one key one, and the second one is building the channel out.', \"Unlike the US as an example, where the carriers in the US sell the vast majority of phones that are sold in the United States, in India, the carriers in general sell virtually no phones, and it is out in retail, and retail is many, many different small shops. We've been in the process. It's not something we just started in the last few weeks.\", \"We've been working in India now for a couple of years or more, but we've been working with great energy over the last 18 months or so, and I am encouraged by the results that we're beginning to see there, and believe there's a lot, lot more there. It is already the third largest smart phone market in the world, but because the smart phones that are working there are low-end, primarily because of the network and the economics, the market potential has not been as great there. I  view India as where China was maybe 7 to 10 years ago from that point of view. I think there's a really great opportunity there.\", 'Nancy Paxton,  Apple Inc. - Senior Director of IR    [18]', 'Thank you, Katy. Could we have the next question please?', 'Operator    [19]', 'We will go to Toni Sacconaghi with Bernstein.', 'Toni Sacconaghi,  Bernstein - Analyst    [20]', \"I have one, and then a follow-up, as well. My sense is that you talked about adjusting for the changes in channel inventory, that you are guiding for relatively normal sequential growth. And I think if you do the math it's probably the same or perhaps a touch worse in terms of iPhone unit growth sequentially, relative to normal seasonality between fiscal Q2 and Q3. I guess the question is, given that you should be entering new markets and you should see pronounced elasticity from the SE device, why wouldn't we be seeing something that was dramatically above normal seasonal, in terms of iPhone revenues and units for this quarter?\", \"Maybe you could push back on me, but I can't help thinking that when Apple introduced the iPad Mini in a similar move, to move down market, there was great growth for one quarter, and the iPad never grew again and margins and ASPs went down. It looks like you are introducing the SE, and at least on a sequential basis, you not calling for any uplift, even adjusting for channel inventory, and ASPs I presume will go down and certainly it's impacting gross margins as you've guided to. Could you respond to, A, why you're not seeing the elasticity, and B, is the analogy with the iPad mini completely misplaced?\", 'Tim Cook,  Apple Inc. - CEO    [21]', \"Toni, it's Tim. Let me see if I can address your question. The channel inventory reduction that Luca referred to, the vast, vast majority of that is in iPhone. That would affect the unit compare that you maybe thinking about. The iPhone SE, we are thrilled with the response that we've seen on it.\", \"It is clear that there is a demand there, even much beyond what we thought, and so that is really why we have the constraint that we have. Do I think it will be like the iPad Mini? No, I don't think so. I don't see that.\", \"I think the tablet market in general, one of the challenges with the tablet market is that the replacement cycle is materially different than in the smart phone market. As you probably know, we haven't had an issue in customer satisfaction on the iPad. It is incredibly high, and we haven't had an issue with usage of the iPad. The usage is incredibly high.\", 'But the consumer behavior there is you tend to hold on for very long period of time, before an upgrade. We continue to be very optimistic on the iPad business, and as I have said in my remarks, we believe we are going to have the best compare for iPad revenue this quarter that we have quite some time. We will report back in July on that one, but I think iPhone has a particularly different kind of cycle to it than the tablet market.', 'Toni Sacconaghi,  Bernstein - Analyst    [22]', \"Okay, and if I could follow-up, Tim. You alluded to replacement cycles and differences between the iPad and the iPhone. My sense was, when you were going through the iPhone 6 cycle, was that you had commented that the upgrade cycle was not materially different. I think your characterization was that it accelerated a bit in the US, but international had grown to be a bigger part of your business, and replacement cycles there were typically a little bit longer. I'm wondering if it was only a modest difference between the 5s and the 6, how big a difference are we really seeing in terms of replacement cycles across the last three generations, and maybe you could help us, if the replacement cycle was flat this year relative to what you saw last year, how different would your results have been this quarter in the first half?\", 'Tim Cook,  Apple Inc. - CEO    [23]', \"There's a lot there. Let me just say I don't recall saying the things that you said I said about the upgrade cycle, so let me get that out of the way. Now let me describe without the specific numbers, the iPhone 6s upgrade cycle that we have measured for the first half of this year, so the first six months of our fiscal year to be precise, is slightly better than the rate that we saw with the iPhone 5s two years ago, but it's lower than the iPhone 6. I don't mean just a hair lower, it's a lot lower.\", \"Without giving you exact numbers, if we would have the same rate on 6s that we did 6, there would -- it will be time for a huge party. It would be a huge difference. The great news from my point of view is, I think we are strategically positioned very well, because we have announced the SE, we are attracting customers that we previously didn't attract. That's really great, and this tough compare eventually isn't the benchmark. The install base is up 80% over the last two years, and so all of those I think bode well, and the switcher comments I made earlier, I wouldn't underestimate that, because that's very important for us in every geography. Thanks for the question.\", 'Nancy Paxton,  Apple Inc. - Senior Director of IR    [24]', 'Thanks, Toni. Can we have the next question please?', 'Operator    [25]', \"From Cross Research Group, we'll hear from Shannon Cross.\", 'Shannon Cross,  Cross Research - Analyst    [26]', \"I have a couple of questions. One, Tim, can you talk a bit about what's going on in China? The greater China revenue I think was down 26%. You did talk about mainland China, but if you could talk about some of the trends you're seeing there, and how you think it's playing out, and maybe your thoughts on SE adoption within  China as well.\", 'Tim Cook,  Apple Inc. - CEO    [27]', \"Shannon, thanks for the question. If you take greater China, we include Taiwan, Hong Kong, and mainland China in the greater China segment that you see reported on your data sheet. The vast majority of the weakness in the greater China region sits in Hong Kong, and our perspective on that is, it's a combination of the Hong Kong dollar being pegged to the US dollar, and therefore it carries the burden of the strength of the US dollar, and that has driven tourism, international shopping and trading down significantly compared to what it was in the year ago.\", 'If you look at mainland China, which is one that I am personally very focused on, we are down 11% in mainland China, on a reported basis. On a constant currency basis, we are only down 7%, and the way that we really look at the health or underlying demand is look at sell-through, and if you look at there, we were down 5%. Keep in mind that is down 5% on comp a year ago that was up 81%.', \"As I  back up from this and look at the larger picture, I think China is not weak, as has been talked about. I see China as -- may not have the wind at our backs that we once did, but it's a lot more stable than what I think is the common view of it. We remain really optimistic on China. We opened seven stores there during the quarter.\", \"We are now at 35. We will open 5 more this quarter to achieve 40, which we had talked about before. And the LTE adoption continues to rise there, but it's got a long way ahead of it. And so we continue to be really optimistic about it, and just would ask folks to  look underneath the numbers at the details in them before concluding anything. Thanks for the question.\", 'Shannon Cross,  Cross Research - Analyst    [28]', 'Thanks. My second question is with regard to OpEx leverage, or thinking about when I look at the revenue, your revenue is below our expectations but OpEx is pretty much in line. So how are you thinking about potential for leverage, cost containment, maybe when macro is bad and revenue is under pressure, and how are you juggling that versus the required investment you need to go forward?', 'Luca Maestri,  Apple Inc. - CFO    [29]', \"It is Luca. Of course, we think about it. We think about it a lot, and so when you look at our results, for example, our OpEx for the quarter, for the March quarter was up 10%, which is the lowest rate that you have seen in years. And when you look within OpEx, you actually see two different dynamics. You see continued significant investments in research and development, because we really believe that's the future of the Company.\", \"We continue to invest in initiatives and projects ahead of revenue. We had a much broader portfolio that we used to have. We do much more in-house technology development than we used to do a few years ago, which we think is a great investment for us to make. And so that parts we didn't need to protect, and we want to continue to invest in the business, right?\", 'And then when you look at our SG&A portion of OpEx for the March quarter, it was actually down slightly. So obviously we think about it, and of course we look at our revenue trends, and we take measures accordingly. When you look at the guidance that we provided for the June quarter, that 10% year-over-year increase that I mentioned to you for the March quarter goes down to a range of 7% to 9% up, and again, the focus is on making investments in Road and continuing to run SG&A extremely tightly, and in a very disciplined way.', \"As you know, our E2R, expense to revenue ratio, is around 10%. It's something that we are very proud of, it's a number that is incredibly competitive in our industry, and we want to continue to keep it that way. At the same time, we don't want to under-invest in the business.\", 'Shannon Cross,  Cross Research - Analyst    [30]', 'Thank you.', 'Nancy Paxton,  Apple Inc. - Senior Director of IR    [31]', 'Thank you, Shannon. Could we have the next question please?', 'Operator    [32]', 'From UBS we hear from Steve Milunovich.', 'Steve Milunovich,  UBS - Analyst    [33]', \"Tim,  I first wanted to ask you about services and how do you view services? You've obviously highlighted it the last two quarters. Do you view it going forward as a primary driver of earnings, or do you view it, and you mentioned platforms in terms of your operating systems, which I would agree with. In that scenario I would argue it's more a supporter of the ecosystem, and a supporter of the hardware margins over time, and therefore somewhat subservient to hardware. It's great that it's growing, but longer-term, I would view its role as more creating an ecosystem that supports the high margins on the hardware, as opposed to independently driving earnings. How do you think about it?\", 'Tim Cook,  Apple Inc. - CEO    [34]', \"The most important thing for us, Steve, is that we want to have a great customer experience, so overwhelmingly, the thing that drives us are to embark on services that help that, and become a part of the ecosystem. The reality is that in doing so, we have developed a very large and profitable business in the services area, and so we felt last quarter and working up to that, that we should pull back the curtain so that people could -- our investors could see the services business, both in terms of the scale of it, and the growth of it. As we said earlier, the purchase value of the installed base services grew by 27% during the quarter, which was an acceleration over the previous quarter, and the value of it hit -- was just shy of $10 billion. It's huge, and we felt it was important to spell that out.\", 'Steve Milunovich,  UBS - Analyst    [35]', \"Okay, and then going back to the upgrades of the installed base, you have clearly mentioned that you've  pulled forward some demand, which makes sense, but there does seem to be a lengthening of the upgrade cycle, particularly in the US. AT&T and Verizon have talked about that. Investors I think perceive  that maybe the marginal improvements on the phone might be less currently, and could be less going forward. At the same time, I think you just announced that you can get the upgrade program online, which I guess potentially could shorten it. Do you believe that upgrade cycles are currently lengthening, and can continue to do so?\", 'Tim Cook,  Apple Inc. - CEO    [36]', \"What we've seen is that it depends on what you compare it to. If you compare to the 5s, what we are seeing is the upgrade rate today is slightly higher, or that there are more people upgrading, if you will, in a similar time period, in terms of a rate, than the 5s. But if you compare to 6, you would clearly arrive at the opposite conclusion. I think it depends on people's reference points, and we thought it very important in this call to be very clear and transparent about what we're seeing. I think in retrospect, you could look at it and say, maybe the appropriate measure is more to the 5s, and I think everybody intuitively thought that the upgrades were accelerated with the 6, and in retrospect, when you look at the periods, they clearly were.\", 'Steve Milunovich,  UBS - Analyst    [37]', 'Thank you.', 'Nancy Paxton,  Apple Inc. - Senior Director of IR    [38]', 'Thanks, Steve. Could we have our next question, please?', 'Operator    [39]', 'We will go to Rod Hall with JPMorgan.', 'Rod Hall,  JPMorgan - Analyst    [40]', \"Yes, thanks for fitting me in. I wanted to start with a general, more general question. I guess, Tim, this one is aimed at you. As you think about where you thought things were going to head last quarter, when you reported to us, and how it's changed this quarter, obviously it's kind of a disappointing demand environment. Can you just help us understand what maybe the top two or three things are that have changed? And so as we walk away from this, we understand what the differences are, and what the direction of change is? Then I have a follow-up.\", 'Tim Cook,  Apple Inc. - CEO    [41]', \"I think you're probably indirectly asking about our trough comment, if you will, from last quarter. And when we made that, we did not contemplate or comprehend that we were going to make a $2 billion-plus reduction in channel inventory during this quarter. So if you factor that in and look at true customer demand, which is the way that we look at internally, I think you'll find a much more reasonable comparison.\", 'Rod Hall,  JPMorgan - Analyst    [42]', 'Okay, great. Thank you. And then for my follow-up, I wanted to ask you about the tax situation a little bit. Treasury obviously has made some rule changes, and I wonder, maybe if Luca, you could comment on what the impact to Apple from those is, if anything? and Tim, maybe more broadly how you see the tax situation for Apple looking forward? Thanks.', 'Luca Maestri,  Apple Inc. - CFO    [43]', \"Yes, Rod, these are new regulations, and we are in the processing of assessing them. Frankly from first read, we don't anticipate that they are going to have any material impact on our tax situation. Some of them relate to inversion transactions, obviously that's not an issue for us. Some of them are around internal debt financing, which is not something that we use, so we don't expect any issue there.\", \"As you know, we are the largest US taxpayer by a wide margin, and we already pay full US tax on all the profits from the sales that we make in the United States, so we don't expect them to have any impact on us on tax reform. I will let Tim continue to  provide more color, but we've been strong advocates for comprehensive corporate tax reform in this country. We continue to do that. We think a reform of the tax code would have significant benefits for the entire US economy, and we remain optimistic that we are going to get to a point where we can see that tax reform enacted. At that point in time, of course, we would have much more flexibility around optimizing our capital structure, and around providing more return of capital to our investors.\", 'Tim Cook,  Apple Inc. - CEO    [44]', \"The only thing I would add, Rod, is I think there are a growing number of people in both parties that would like to see comprehensive reform, and so I'm optimistic that it will occur. It's just a matter of when and that's difficult to say. But I think most people do recognize that it is in the US's interest to do this.\", 'Rod Hall,  JPMorgan - Analyst    [45]', 'Great, thanks.', 'Nancy Paxton,  Apple Inc. - Senior Director of IR    [46]', \"Thank you, Rod.

      "[\"Good day, and welcome to the Apple Inc. Fourth Quarter Fiscal Year 2018 Earnings Conference Call. Today's call is being recorded. At this time, for opening remarks and introductions, I would like to turn the call over to Nancy Paxton, Senior Director of Investor Relations. Please go ahead.\", 'Nancy Paxton,  Apple Inc. - Senior Director of IR and Treasury    [2]', \"Thank you. Good afternoon, and thanks to everyone for joining us. Speaking first today is Apple's CEO, Tim Cook; and he'll be followed by CFO, Luca Maestri. After that, we'll open the call to questions from analysts.\", \"Please note that some of the information you'll hear during our discussion today will consist of forward-looking statements, including, without limitation, those regarding revenue, gross margin, operating expenses, other income and expense, taxes, capital allocation and future business outlook. Actual results or trends could differ materially from our forecast.\", \"For more information, please refer to the risk factors discussed in Apple's most recently filed periodic reports on Form 10-K and Form 10-Q and the Form 8-K filed with the SEC today, along with the associated press release. Apple assumes no obligation to update any forward-looking statements or information which speak as of their respective dates.\", \"I'd now like to turn the call over to Tim for introductory remarks.\", 'Timothy D. Cook,  Apple Inc. - CEO & Director    [3]', 'Thank you, Nancy. Good afternoon, everyone, and thanks for joining us. I just got back from Brooklyn, where we marked our fourth major launch at the end of the year. In addition to being a great time, it put an exclamation point at the end of a remarkable fiscal 2018.', \"This year, we shipped our 2 billionth iOS device, celebrated the 10th anniversary of the App Store and achieved the strongest revenue and earnings in Apple's history. In fiscal year '18, our revenue grew by $36.4 billion. That's the equivalent of a Fortune 100 company in a single year. And we're capping all that off with our best September quarter ever.\", \"Revenue was $62.9 billion, ahead of our expectations. That's an increase of 20% over last year and our highest growth rate in 3 years. We also generated record Q4 earnings with 41% year-over-year growth in EPS. Record results from iPhone, Services and Wearables drove our momentum, and we produced strong double-digit revenue growth in all of our geographic segments.\", \"It was a big year and a big quarter for iPhone. Q4 revenue was up 29% over last year, an increase of over $8 billion to a new September quarter record, fueled by continued momentum for iPhone 8, 8 Plus and X and the very successful launch of iPhone Xs and iPhone Xs Max. These latest devices are our most advanced iPhones ever with the industry's first 7-nanometer A12 Bionic chip with an Apple-designed 8-core Neural Engine capable of executing an astounding 5 trillion operations per second.\", 'The A12 Bionic is many years in the making and a huge technological leap forward. It sets the iPhone experience far apart from the competition using real-time machine learning to transform the way we experience photo, gaming, augmented reality and more. It makes full use of the dual-camera system that shoots portrait mode photos with Smart HDR and dynamic depth of field, and Face ID is even faster.', 'The response has been powerful. As one reviewer put it, \"iPhone Xs and Xs Max are the perfect blend of design and craftsmanship as well as seamlessly intuitive user experience.\" We\\'re not done yet. Just last week, we began shipping iPhone XR, bringing the latest iPhone breakthroughs to even more users. With an all-screen glass and aluminum design and the most advanced LCD in a smartphone, the product reviews had been overwhelmingly positive.', \"iOS 12 has gotten off to an incredible start. It's been installed on more systems in its first month than any version of iOS ever. iOS 12 is delivering system-wide performance enhancements, Siri Shortcuts and new tools to help people reduce interruption and manage screen time for themselves and their kids.\", \"Siri Shortcuts, in particular, is already deeply integrated with some of the most popular apps out there. Whether you're tracking your workouts or rushing to catch a flight, you can be sure all of your most relevant apps are working together with Siri in the driver seat.\", \"iOS 12 also features ARKit 2, a major upgrade to our augmented reality engine. ARKit 2 makes possible simultaneous multi-user experiences and real-world object incorporation. Our developer community is really running with this technology. From gaming to shopping, we're seeing great new use cases emerge. iOS devices deliver the best AR experiences of any products in the market today, and with the announcement of our new iPad Pro this week, we've made that gap even wider.\", 'More powerful than the vast majority of PC laptops, the new iPad Pro is unrivaled in its versatility and performance. And paired with the beautifully refined Apple Pencil and a new streamlined full-size smart keyboard, iPad Pro will extend its lead as the ultimate creativity and productivity device. And finally, just this week, we delivered the hotly anticipated group FaceTime functionality to all FaceTime-enabled devices.', 'For Services, it was our best quarter ever with revenue at $10 billion. Excluding the impact of a favorable onetime accounting adjustment of $640 million a year ago, our Services growth was 27%.', 'We set new Q4 records in all of our geographic segments and new all-time revenue records for the App Store, cloud services, AppleCare, Apple Music and Apple Pay. We also continued to see strong growth in paid subscriptions, reaching over 330 million in our ecosystem.', 'I want to spotlight the exceptional performance of Apple Pay, which is, by far, the #1 mobile contactless payment service worldwide. Transaction volume tripled year-over-year, and to put that into perspective, Apple Pay generated significantly more transactions than even PayPal mobile with over 4x the growth rate.', 'As a testament to accelerating U.S. growth, Costco completed the rollout of Apple Pay to over 500 U.S. warehouses last quarter, while Neiman Marcus is now accepting Apple Pay at over 40 stores across the country. With these additions, 71 of the top 100 merchants and 60% of all U.S. retail locations support Apple Pay.', 'We continue to invest in our strategy to replace the wallet with the recent launch of student ID passes at several major U.S. universities. And 10 months following its launch, Apple Pay Cash is the highest-rated mobile peer-to-peer service by Consumer Reports based on exceptional payment authentication and data privacy.', 'We set an all-time quarterly record for Mac revenue, thanks to strong performance in MacBook Pro and the impact of the back-to-school season. In September, we delivered macOS Mojave, bringing powerful new features to Mac like dark mode, stack and a completely redesigned Mac App Store. Considered alongside the release of iOS 12, watchOS 5 and a new tvOS, macOS Mojave tells a powerful story of the seamless integration of world-class hardware, software and services that define the Apple ecosystem.', \"As I mentioned at the beginning of the call, earlier this week, we announced exciting updates to the Mac lineup. The all-new MacBook Air brings a stunning Retina display, Touch ID, the latest processors and an even more portable design to the world's most beloved notebook. We also unveiled the biggest update ever to Mac mini, the small yet muscular desktop that powers everything from the music and sound effects of Broadway shows to the developers who build some of the most popular apps in the App Store. The new Mac mini boasts an amazing 5x faster performance than before.\", \"With revenue growth over 50%, it was another record quarter for Wearables, which includes Apple Watch, AirPods and Beats products. With the highest customer satisfaction in the industry, Apple Watch has become an essential part of people's lives. The customer response to the Apple Watch Series 4 has been overwhelmingly positive, driven by its all-new design, larger display, faster performance, fall detection, enhanced cellular reception and electrical heart sensor.\", 'Later this year, the ECG app will be available to Apple Watch Series 4 customers in the U.S., giving them the ability to take an electrocardiogram anytime right from their wrists. And for U.S. customers with Apple Watch Series 1 and later, watchOS will soon enable periodic checks for irregular heart rhythms that may be suggestive of AFib. These are unprecedented and potentially life changing features, showing how Apple Watch is not only an indispensable communication and fitness companion but also an intelligent guardian for your health. More broadly, we see this as just one further example of the kind of contribution we can make in the health space, and we look forward to making more in the future.', 'We are proud to bring HomePod to new customers. I was in Spain last week as HomePod became available there and in Mexico. HomePod delivers the highest fidelity audio quality, working together with an Apple Music subscription to stream over 50 million songs into any room in your home.', 'Our retail team posted record Q4 results to conclude their biggest year ever. They are transforming our stores into places where customers come to connect, learn and be inspired together with people from their community. Our Today at Apple sessions are a terrific example of what that looks like in practice. We hosted over 250,000 Today at Apple sessions this quarter, connecting aspiring creators with local photographers, illustrators and other experts who can help them get the most out of their devices. Apple Stores also hosted 74,000 kids at Apple Camp.', 'The relationship Apple has with our customers is about more than just making a purchase. With the recent addition of beautiful new stores in Italy, Japan, China and in just a few weeks, Thailand, we will have 506 stores where we can further those relationships, almost half of which are outside United States.', \"Before I turn the call over to Luca, I'd like to touch on 2 items that may not show up in our financial statement but are just as integral to Apple's mission and our commitment to making the world a better place.\", \"First, education. More than 5,000 schools, community colleges and technical colleges worldwide are now using Everyone Can Code, our free coding curriculum. Ideas, creativity and passion for technology's potential aren't limited by ZIP code or country, and we don't think opportunity should be either. We're also excited that educators in more than 350 schools around the world have started working with Everyone Can Create, the free collection of tools and project guides we introduced this spring designed to help unleash kids' creativity throughout their school day with the help of iPad.\", \"Next is the environment. This was a milestone year for Apple's commitment to our planet. In April, we announced that 100% of our global operations are powered by renewable energy. We also made progress in doing the same in our supply chain. And just this week, we announced that the enclosures of new products like MacBook Air and iPad Pro will be made from 100% recycled aluminum, a strong, durable and beautiful new alloy designed by Apple.\", \"This is a great example of how a commitment to do right on the issues that matter can drive once unimaginable innovation, new ways of approaching old problems and beautiful solutions that set us apart. I'd like to thank all of our employees, customers, developers and business partners for helping us deliver outstanding results across our fiscal 2018. We are headed into the holidays with our strongest product lineup ever, and we could not be more bullish about Apple's future.\", 'And now Luca has more details to share with you on the September quarter. Luca?', 'Luca Maestri,  Apple Inc. - CFO & Senior VP    [4]', 'Thank you, Tim. Good afternoon, everyone. We are extremely pleased to report record results for our September quarter, which capped a tremendously successful fiscal 2018, a year in which we saw double-digit revenue growth in every geographic segment and established new revenue and earnings records in every single quarter.', 'Revenue in the fourth quarter was $62.9 billion, up 20% and more than $10 billion over last year with strong double-digit growth in each of our geographic segments and record Q4 revenue in the Americas, in Europe, Japan and rest of Asia Pacific. In fact, we set new revenue records in almost every market we track with especially strong growth in Germany, Italy, Sweden, Switzerland, Japan and Korea, all major markets where revenue growth was 25% or higher. We also set new fourth quarter revenue records for iPhone and Wearables and new all-time records for Services and Mac.', 'Gross margin was 38.3%, flat sequentially in line with our expectations as leverage from higher revenue offset seasonal transition costs. We set new September quarter records for net income, EPS and cash flow from operations. Net income was $14.1 billion, up $3.4 billion or 32% over last year. Diluted earnings per share were $2.91, up 41%. Cash flow from operations was $19.5 billion, up $3.8 billion from a year ago.', 'iPhone revenue grew 29% with growth of more than 20% in every geographic segment. iPhone ASP was $793 compared to $618 a year ago, driven by strong performance of iPhone X, 8 and 8 Plus as well as the successful launch of iPhone Xs and Xs Max in the September quarter this year, while we launched iPhone X in the December quarter last year.', 'We sold 46.9 million iPhones during the quarter with growth of 20% or more in several markets, including Japan, Australia, New Zealand, Sweden, Norway, Chile and Vietnam. Customer satisfaction with iPhone continues to be outstanding and is the highest in the industry. The latest survey of U.S. consumers from 451 Research indicates customer satisfaction of 98% for iPhone X, 8 and 8 Plus combined. And among business buyers who plan to purchase smartphones in the December quarter, 80% plan to purchase iPhones.', 'Turning to Services. It was our best quarter ever in total and virtually in every market around the world with revenue of $10 billion. A year ago, we had a onetime $640 million favorable impact to Services revenue due to an accounting adjustment, and taking that into account, our Services growth in Q4 this year was 27%. As Tim mentioned, we reached new all-time quarterly revenue records for many Services categories, and we are well on our way to achieve our goal to double our fiscal 2016 Services revenue by 2020.', 'We now have over 330 million paid subscriptions on our platform, an increase of over 50% versus a year ago. We are very pleased not only with the growth but also with the breadth of our subscription business. In fact, 30,000 third-party subscription apps are available in the App Store today, and the largest of them all represents less than 0.3% of our total Services revenue.', \"Next, I'd like to talk about the Mac. We saw great response to our new MacBook Pro models that we launched in July with strong double-digit revenue growth driving an all-time quarterly record for Mac revenue. We were especially pleased with Mac momentum in emerging markets with strong growth in Latin America, in India, the Middle East and Africa and Central and Eastern Europe. At over 100 million units, our active installed base of Macs is at an all-time high, and the majority of customer purchasing Macs in the September quarter were new to Mac.\", 'We sold 9.7 million iPads during the quarter, gaining share in nearly every market we track based on the latest estimates from IDC. We generated iPad growth in a number of key regions around the world, including Latin America, Europe, Japan, India and South Asia. Among customers around the world purchasing iPads during the quarter, nearly half were new to iPad, and our active installed base of iPads reached a new all-time high.', 'NPD indicates that iPad had 58% share of the U.S. tablet market in the September quarter, up from 54% share a year ago. And the most recent consumer survey from 451 Research measured iPad customer satisfaction ratings of 96% for both iPad and iPad Pro. And among business customers who plan to purchase tablets in the December quarter, 74% plan to purchase iPads.', 'Other products revenue grew 31% to a new September quarter record with an increase of over $1 billion compared to a year ago, thanks to Wearables growth of over 50% and the strong performance of Apple TV in addition to the introduction of HomePod earlier this year.', 'As we look back across fiscal 2018, we have made great progress in the enterprise market, where iOS is transforming how business gets done across multiple industries. In fact, over 450 airlines and 47 of the top 50 around the world have adopted iOS to help pilots fly safer, more efficient flights. And many airlines are also using iOS to support better customer experiences and improve maintenance operations.', \"We're also making great strides in the retail sector, where 9 of the top 10 global retailers use iOS devices to transform their customer and employee experiences. We are seeing industry-wide adoption of iOS at thousands of retailers from neighborhood boutiques to many of the best-known retailers in the world. Deployment of iOS devices is growing steadily as retailers replace their traditional point-of-sale systems and use custom iOS apps on iPhones and iPads to provide highly personalized shopping experiences.\", 'Our success in enterprise is supported by our key partnerships. Since launching our first strategic partnership with IBM, 240 large customers have signed MobileFirst for iOS deals. Additionally, earlier in the year, we introduced 2 new technology offerings: IBM Watson services for Core ML and the IBM Cloud Developer Console for Apple that are enabling businesses to combine machine learning and cloud for a new generation of dynamic smart apps made for iOS. Over 60 new signings across numerous industries have been added since launching these new tools.', \"In our new partnership with Salesforce, we're excited to bring together the #1 customer relationship management platform and iOS. Together with Apple, Salesforce is redesigning its apps to embrace the native mobile platform with exclusive new features on iOS. The company can also provide tools and resources for millions of Salesforce developers to build their own native apps with a new Salesforce Mobile SDK for iOS.\", 'And finally, we recently announced Apple business manager, a new way for IT teams to deploy Apple devices at scale. The response from companies around the world has been tremendous with over 40,000 companies currently enrolled.', 'Let me now turn to our cash position. We ended the quarter with $237.1 billion in cash plus marketable securities. We also had $102.5 billion in term debt and $12 billion in commercial paper outstanding for a net cash position of $122.6 billion. As explained earlier this year, it is our plan to reach a net cash neutral position over time. As part of this plan, we returned over $23 billion to investors during the quarter. We repurchased 92.5 million Apple shares for $19.4 billion through open market transactions, and we paid $3.5 billion in dividends and equivalents.', 'For our fiscal year 2018, revenue grew over $36 billion to $265.6 billion, an all-time record. Every geographic segment grew double digits with new records in the Americas, Europe, Japan and rest of Asia Pacific. We also set new all-time records for net income, up 23% versus last year and EPS, up 29%. And we returned a total of almost $90 billion to our investors during the year, including almost $14 billion in dividends and equivalents and over $73 billion in share repurchases.', \"Before we discuss our December quarter outlook, I'd like to describe a number of changes in our financial reporting that we're implementing as we enter our new fiscal year. First, given the increasing importance of our Services business and in order to provide additional transparency to our financial results, we will start reporting revenue as well as cost of sales for both total products and total services beginning this December quarter.\", \"Second, also beginning this December quarter, we're adopting the FASB's new standard for revenue recognition. This will not result in any change to our total revenue, but it will impact the way we report the classification of revenue between products and services. In particular, the revenue corresponding to the amortization of the deferred value of bundled services such as Maps, Siri and free iCloud services was previously reported in product revenue. After adopting the new standards, this revenue will now be reported in Services revenue.\", 'The change in classification between products and services will also apply to the costs that are associated with the delivery of such bundled services. After we file our 10-K, we will post a schedule to our Investor Relations website showing the reclassification of fiscal 2018 revenue from products to services in connection with the adoption of the new standard.', \"The size of this reclassification amounts to less than 1% of total company revenues. And for clarity, this reclassification was not contemplated in our previously stated goal of doubling our fiscal '16 Services revenue by 2020. That goal remains unchanged and excludes the revenue that is now shifting from products to services over that time frame.\", \"Third, starting with the December quarter, we will no longer be providing unit sales data for iPhone, iPad and Mac. As we have stated many times, our objective is to make great products and services that enrich people's lives and to provide an unparalleled customer experience so that our users are highly satisfied, loyal and engaged. As we accomplish these objectives, strong financial results follow.\", 'As demonstrated by our financial performance in recent years, the number of units sold in any 90-day period is not necessarily representative of the underlying strength of our business. Furthermore, our unit of sale is less relevant for us today than it was in the past given the breadth of our portfolio and the wider sales price dispersion within any given product line.', 'Fourth, starting with the December quarter, we will be renaming the other products category to wearables, home and accessories to provide a more accurate description of the items that are included in this product category.', \"As we move ahead to the December quarter, I'd like to review our outlook, which includes the types of forward-looking information that Nancy referred to at the beginning of the call. We have the strongest lineup ever as we enter the holiday season, and we expect revenue to be between $89 billion and $93 billion, a new all-time record. This range reflects a number of factors to be considered: First, we consider the effect on Q4 and Q1 of the launch timing of our new iPhones this year versus last year; Second, we expect almost $2 billion of foreign exchange headwinds; Third, we had an unprecedented number of products ramping, and while our ramps are going fairly well, we have uncertainty around supply and demand balance; and fourth, we also face some macroeconomic uncertainty, particularly in emerging markets.\", 'We expect gross margin to be between 38% and 38.5%. We expect OpEx to be between $8.7 billion and $8.8 billion. We expect OI&E to be about $300 million. And we expect the tax rate to be about 16.5% before discrete items. Also, today, our Board of Directors has declared a cash dividend of $0.73 per share of common stock payable on November 15, 2018, to shareholders of record as of November 12, 2018.', \"With that, I'd like to open the call to questions.\", 'Nancy Paxton,  Apple Inc. - Senior Director of IR and Treasury    [5]', 'Thank you, Luca. (Operator Instructions)', 'Questions and Answers', 'Operator    [1]', 'Our first question will come from Wamsi Mohan with Bank of America Merrill Lynch.', 'Wamsi Mohan,  BofA Merrill Lynch, Research Division - Director    [2]', 'Tim, there has been some real deceleration in some of these emerging markets, partly driven by some concerns around some of the rules the administration is contemplating and partly driven by things that are more specific to China, for instance, like some of the regulations around gaming. So can you talk about how you see the trajectory there for the business and what you think of the initiatives of some companies like Netflix and Fortnite trying to bypass the App Store around subscriptions? And I have a follow-up.', 'Timothy D. Cook,  Apple Inc. - CEO & Director    [3]', \"Sure. Great question. Starting with emerging markets. The emerging markets that we're seeing pressure in are markets like Turkey, India, Brazil, Russia, these are markets where currencies have weakened over the recent period. In some cases, that resulted in us raising prices, and those markets are not growing the way we would like to see. To give you a perspective in -- at some detail, our business at India in Q4 was flat. Obviously, we would like to see that be a huge growth. Brazil was down somewhat compared to the previous year. And so I think -- or at least the way that I see these is each one of the emerging markets has a bit of a different story. And I don't see it as some sort of issue that is common between those for the most part. In relation to China specifically, I would not put China in that category. Our business in China was very strong last quarter. We grew 16%, which we're very happy with. iPhone, in particular, was very strong double-digit growth there. Our other products category was also stronger, in fact, a bit stronger than even the company -- overall company number. The App Store in China, we have seen a slowdown or a moratorium to be more accurate on new game approvals. There is a new regulatory setup in China, and there's -- things are not moving the way they were moving previously. We did see a few games approved recently, but it's very far below the historic pace. And as you're probably seeing, some of the larger companies there that are public have talked about this as they've announced their earnings as well. We don't know exactly when this will -- the approvals will sort of return to a normal pace. So I would not want to predict that. I do not view, just to try -- for avoidance of doubt here, I don't view that, that issue has anything to do with the trade-related discussions between the countries. I think that is strictly a domestic issue in China. In terms of larger developers, if you sort of step back and look at the value proposition for people from the App Store, there are 2 key constituencies in that equation. There's the user, and there's the developer. If you start with the user, what the App Store provides people is sort of the best and safest place for users to get apps. And we put a -- we have a tremendous process and infrastructure around achieving that. And where it is not perfect, we wind up reviewing 100,000 -- over 100,000 apps a week between new apps and updates for existing apps and then work with developers quickly to fix the issues. And we also provide the user a one-payment model for purchasing apps and subscriptions and in-app purchases, et cetera, so that they are not in a position that they have to share their private information across many companies. And so that's sort of the proposition for the user. For the developer, we obviously provide developers a tremendous amount of developer tools, programs, compilers, languages, of course, the operating system APIs, SDKs and have a huge developer relations team. And we do a tremendous amount of marketing for developers, including the new Today editorial that we just started in the past few months, personal recommendations search, tools and so on and so forth. And so if -- there will be -- there's no doubt, in my mind, there have already been some large developers that concluded that they could do something on their own. We're fine with that. I think Luca mentioned in his comments that the largest -- if I look at the largest developer, they make up less than 0.3% of the Services revenue. So it's probably good to think about that in that context, and there are millions of apps on the store obviously and 30,000 or so subscription apps. And so the subscription business itself is nearly as broad as the App Store itself is. And so that's the value proposition, I think, that the vast majority of people are very happy with it and including the most important people of all, which is the user.\", 'Wamsi Mohan,  BofA Merrill Lynch, Research Division - Director    [4]', \"Appreciate that response. If I could just ask you really quick on Apple's role in health care. It's been growing significantly since the early introduction on the Watch and then the various kits for developers, including HealthKit, CareKit, et cetera. And when you combine that with your very staunch advocacy for privacy, I see Apple could become a really large disintermediating force in all the friction in the health care industry today in the way medical information is shared and distributed. Is this the way that you see the future for Apple in health care? And do you see a means to also grow your Services business through the health care offerings that could become subscriptions to your customers?\", 'Timothy D. Cook,  Apple Inc. - CEO & Director    [5]', \"I think Apple has a huge opportunity in the -- in health. And you can see from the -- our past several years that we have an intense interest in the space and are adding products and services, non-monetized services so far to that. And I don't want to talk about the future because I don't want to give away what we're doing. But this is an area of major interest to us.\", 'Operator    [6]', 'Shannon Cross from Cross Research has the next question.', 'Shannon Siemsen Cross,  Cross Research LLC - Co-Founder, Principal & Analyst    [7]', \"Given the $4 billion range in revenue that you're giving for the quarter and all of the -- all the things that are going on in the world right now, can you maybe give a little detail about the variables that you took into account when you were coming up with this, geopolitical trade, macro component costs, I don't know, if you can just give it some ideas as -- on what the puts and takes were?\", 'Luca Maestri,  Apple Inc. - CFO & Senior VP    [8]', \"Yes. Shannon, I'll take this one. And at the revenue level, we started from the fact that we are very, very excited about the lineup of products and services that we have getting into the holiday season. It's the strongest lineup that we've ever had. And our guidance range, by the way, represents a new all-time quarterly revenue record, right? As I explained in my prepared remarks, there are a number of things that need to be considered as part of this guidance range, right? The first one is the fact that the launch timing of the new iPhones this year is essentially in reverse order versus last year. And that has had an effect on Q1 -- on Q4 and will have an effect on Q1. Last year, we launched the top end of our iPhone lineup, which was iPhone X during Q1, and placed the entirety of the channel fill for iPhone X in Q1. This year, we launched the top end of the lineup, which is the Xs and the Xs Max during Q4. Obviously, this resulted in a more pronounced ASP growth in Q4 of '18 and obviously a tougher compare for Q1. So I think it's important to keep that in mind as you look at the revenue guidance that we provided. The second point that needs to be kept in mind, it is a fact of life and we've dealt with it for a number of years now, is the fact that when I look at currencies around the world, virtually every foreign currency has depreciated against the U.S. dollar in the last 12 months. And when we look at the impact of foreign exchange on our revenue for the December quarter, we're looking at 200 basis points of headwinds, which translate, given our -- the size of our business, to almost $2 billion of headwind to our revenue. The third point that I think is important to keep in mind, and Tim has talked about this, we are launching -- in the last 6 weeks, we've launched an unprecedented number of new products. They're all ramping right now. The ramps are going fairly well, but obviously, we have some uncertainty around supply-demand balance for some of these products. And then finally, the last point that we've taken into account is what Tim's talked about in terms of some level of uncertainty at the macroeconomic level in some emerging markets, where, clearly, consumer confidence is not as high as it was 12 months ago. So take that into account, and that's how we got to the range.\", 'Shannon Siemsen Cross,  Cross Research LLC - Co-Founder, Principal & Analyst    [9]', \"Okay. And then I just want to talk a little bit about the pullback in terms of guidance from a unit perspective. I understand you don't want to give guidance because 90 days is a short period of time and can be -- fluctuate. But what kind of qualitative commentary do you think you'll be able to provide? Because it's -- obviously, investors have spent the last however many years going P times Q. So how should we think about what we can expect? And sort of how are you going to manage this process as we go through? I know it's all our job to forecast but...\", 'Luca Maestri,  Apple Inc. - CFO & Senior VP    [10]', \"Yes, let me walk you through the rationale that we've used, and then I'll talk about this qualitative commentary that you were mentioning. As I said, right, our objective is to make great products, provide the best customer experience and get our customers satisfied, engaged and loyal to our ecosystem. When you look at our financial performance in recent years, take the last 3 years, for example, the number of units sold during any quarter has not been necessarily representative of the underlying strength of our business. If you look at our revenue during the last 3 years, if you look at our net income during the last 3 years, if you look at our spot price during the last 3 years, there's no correlation to the units sold in any given period. As you know very well, in addition, our product ranges for all the major product categories have become wider over time, and therefore, a unit of sale is less relevant for us at this point compared to the past because we got this much wider sales price dispersion. So unit of sale per se becomes less relevant. As I know you're aware, by the way, our top competitors in smartphones, in tablets, in computers do not provide quarterly unit sales information either. But of course, we understand that this is something of interest. And when we believe that providing qualitative commentary on unit sales offers additional relevant information to investors, we will do so.\", 'Timothy D. Cook,  Apple Inc. - CEO & Director    [11]', \"Let me make one additional point there just for clarity, is that, Shannon, our intention is to continue to give revenue guidance at the company level and gross margin guidance in the other categories that we've been providing. And so the -- our guidance isn't changing. It's the actual report that changes.\", 'Operator    [12]', 'Our next question comes from Mike Olson with Piper Jaffray.', 'Michael Joseph Olson,  Piper Jaffray Companies, Research Division - MD & Senior Research Analyst    [13]', \"With the staggered iPhone launch, were you able to discern any impact on the Xs and Xs Max from buyers potentially waiting for the XR? And what, if anything, can we take away from the December quarter guidance related to what you're seeing for early demand on the XR? And then I have a follow-up.\", 'Timothy D. Cook,  Apple Inc. - CEO & Director    [14]', \"Mike, it's Tim. The Xs and Xs Max got off to a really great start, and we've only been selling for a few weeks. The XR, we've only got out there for, I guess, 5 -- 5 days or so at this point and so that it's -- we have very, very little data there. Usually, there is some amount of wait until a product shows -- another product shows up in look, but in -- that -- in looking at the data, on the sales data for Xs and Xs Max, there's not obvious evidence of that in the data as I see it.\", 'Michael Joseph Olson,  Piper Jaffray Companies, Research Division - MD & Senior Research Analyst    [15]', \"Got it. And you mentioned record levels for various components of the Services business. As we look forward, if growth of Services is to maintain something close to the recent pace, what are the components of Services that you're particularly excited about that could drive that and be the strongest drivers? And maybe an offshoot to that, it seems like the news flow around augmented reality slowed a little bit in recent months. Is that potentially materially contributor to services in the near future?\", 'Luca Maestri,  Apple Inc. - CFO & Senior VP    [16]', \"Like as we said, during the September quarter, we set new records for many, many Services categories, right, from Apple Music to cloud services to the App Store to AppleCare and Apple Pay really has an exponential trajectory right now. When we look at our Services business, we think about the fact that we have a very large and growing installed base. The installed base of all our major product categories is at an all-time high and has been growing over the last several quarters. So the opportunity for us to monetize our Services business continues to grow over time. Of course, we are also improving the quality of the services that we provide, and if you look back during the last 3 years, we've added new services to our portfolio. We added Apple Pay. We added Apple Music. We added this advertising business on our App Store. And clearly, we will want to continue to offer new services over time. So there are a number of vectors that allow us to continue to grow the business over time. We have stated that we want to double the size of the Services business from the level that we had in fiscal '16 by 2020. We are well on pace to achieve that, and we feel very, very confident about the future of -- and the opportunities that we have in the Services space.\", 'Timothy D. Cook,  Apple Inc. - CEO & Director    [17]', \"Mike, in terms of your question on AR, I have a different view than you do on this one. We -- just a year ago -- practically, a year ago, we came out with ARKit 1. 6 months or so after that, we came out with 1.5. We then recently came out with ARKit 2. The number of things that you can do are growing significantly. The number of developers that either have done something or even more the case that are working on things that I've seen are growing tremendously. There's a lot of interest out there. And the number of categories that I'm seeing from gaming to shopping to -- I was in China a few weeks ago and saw AR in the -- in an art sense, an art exhibit. I was in Berlin last week and saw it being used in a historical educational kind of sense. I'm seeing it sort of everywhere I go now. And so I think we are in the early days, and it'll keep getting better and better. But I'm really happy with where things are at the moment.\", 'Operator    [18]', \"Next, we'll go to Katy Huberty with Morgan Stanley.\", 'Kathryn Lynn Huberty,  Morgan Stanley, Research Division - MD and Research Analyst    [19]', 'Tim, given the current trade negotiations and broader geopolitical risk, do you have any plans to consider diversifying the supply chain? And if you were to do that, either on your own or sort of forced, do you think it would have significant impact on the business or profitability?', 'Timothy D. Cook,  Apple Inc. - CEO & Director    [20]', \"Katy, if you look at the products that we've created and are manufacturing, they're really manufactured everywhere. We have significant content from the U.S. market. We have content from Japan to Korea to many countries, and we have great content from China as well. And so there are many hands in the products. The vast majority or almost all of the R&D is in the United States as well as a lot of the support organization. And I -- so as -- I think that, that basic model where you look around the world and find the best in different areas, I don't expect that model to go out of style so to speak. I think there's a reason why things have developed in that way, and I think it's great for all countries and citizens of countries that are involved in that. And I'm still of the mindset that I feel very optimistic and positive that the discussions that are going will be fruitful. The -- these relationships, these trade relationships are big and complex, and they clearly do need a level of focus and a level of updating and modernization. And so I'm optimistic of -- that the countries, the U.S. and China and the U.S. and Europe and so forth can work these things out and work for the benefit of everyone.\", 'Kathryn Lynn Huberty,  Morgan Stanley, Research Division - MD and Research Analyst    [21]', \"That's helpful color. And Luca, as a follow-up, NAND prices fell significantly during the September quarter. Why aren't we seeing that flow through to margin expansion to the overall company?\", 'Luca Maestri,  Apple Inc. - CFO & Senior VP    [22]', \"You're referring to the guidance that we provided for Q1, I imagine. And let me give you the puts and takes, Katy. You're correct, we are going to be getting some benefits from commodities in general and memory in particular. Memory, on a sequential basis, it's about 30 basis points favorable for us going into the December quarter. And obviously, we're going to be benefiting from the leverage, which is typical of our seasonality in the December quarter. On the other hand, as I mentioned before, currencies have weakened against the U.S. dollar. And the impact that we expect at the gross margin level from foreign exchange is a 90 basis points headwind sequentially. And of course, at this point in the cycle, we also have higher cost structures because, as I said, we've launched so many new products in the last 6 weeks. So those are the puts and takes, leverage and commodity savings on one side and FX and the new products on the other side.\", 'Operator    [23]', \"Next, we'll go to Jim Suva with Citigroup.\", 'Jim Suva,  Citigroup Inc, Research Division - Director    [24]', \"A question for Tim and a question for Luca, and I'll ask them at the same time, so you can decide to answer the first or second. But operationally, Tim, I think your company is at a disadvantage relative to others in India giving where items are produced versus shipped versus taxed versus installed as well as ability to own stores. So can you help us address that? Is India going to potentially be a big area as I think you've got about only 1% market share, but it sounded like things may be softened there? And then for Luca, there'd probably be a lot of pushback about not giving iPhone unit data. It sounds like you're still going to give revenue data if I heard that correctly. But some people may fear that this now means that the iPhone units are going to start going negative year-over-year because it's easy to talk about great things and not show the details of things that aren't so great.\", 'Timothy D. Cook,  Apple Inc. - CEO & Director    [25]', \"Okay. I'll start with India. We've had really great productive discussions with the Indian government, and I fully expect that, at some point, they will agree to allow us to bring our stores into the country. We've been in discussions with them, and the discussions are going quite well. There is -- as you point out, there are import duties in some or most of the product categories that we're in. In some cases, they compound. And this is an area that we're giving lots of feedback on. We do manufacture some of the entry iPhones in India, and that project has gone well. I am a big believer in India. I am very bullish on the country and the people and our ability to do well there. The currency weakness has been part of our challenge there as you can tell from just looking at the currency trend. But I sort of view these as speed bumps along a very long journey, though, in that the long term is -- I think is very, very strong there. There's a huge number of people that will move into the middle class. The government has really focused on reform in a major way and made some very bold moves, and I applaud them for doing that and sort of can't wait for the future there.\", 'Luca Maestri,  Apple Inc. - CFO & Senior VP    [26]', \"And Jim, let me take the question on units. First of all, as Tim said, our approach to guidance -- providing guidance doesn't change at all, and we continue to provide the same metrics that we were providing before. In terms of reporting results, one of the things that we are doing, and it's new and it's an addition to the information that we provide to investors because we've heard some significant level of interest around this, is starting with the December quarter, for the first time, we're going to be providing information on revenue and cost of sales and therefore, gross margins for both products and services. And this will be the first time that we're going to provide gross margin information for our Services business, which we believe it is an important metric for our investors to follow. Given the rationale on why we do not believe that providing unit sales is particularly relevant for our company at this point, I can reassure you that it is our objective to grow unit sales for every product category that we have. But as I said earlier, a unit of sale is less relevant today than it was in the past. To give you an example, the unit sales of iPhone at the top end of the line have been very strong during the September quarter. And that's very important because we are attracting customers to the most recent technologies and features and innovation that we bring into the lineup, but you don't necessarily see that in the number that is reported. And so therefore, we will -- as I said, we'll provide the qualitative commentary when it is important and relevant, but at the end of the day, we make our decisions to -- from a financial standpoint, to try and optimize our revenue and our gross margin dollars. And that, we think, is the focus that is in the best interest of our investors.\", 'Timothy D. Cook,  Apple Inc. - CEO & Director    [27]', 'Jim, let me just add a couple things to that for color. Our installed base is growing at double digit, and so there\\'s no -- and that\\'s probably a much more significant metric for us from an ecosystem point of view and customer loyalty, et cetera. The second thing is this is a little bit like if you go to the market and you push your cart up to the cashier and she says or he says, \"How many units you have in there?\", it sort of -- it doesn\\'t matter a lot how many units there are in there in terms of the overall value of what\\'s in the cart.', 'Nancy Paxton,  Apple Inc. - Senior Director of IR and Treasury    [28]', \"A replay of today's call will be available for 2 weeks on Apple Podcasts, as a webcast on apple.com/investor and via telephone.
